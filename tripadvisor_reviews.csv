30,"This is the hotel to stay at if you want to get in early to Tikal and a must if you want the sunrise visit. Because of that it really doesn’t have to try too hard and it doesn’t. Don’t get me wrong, everything is ok, food is ok, rooms were ok it is just with a bit more effort it could have been so much better. As I say, stay for the location and put up with it, your visit to Tikal will blow you away anyway!"
50,"This place is great, located at the entrance of Tikal national park, with beautiful rooms, a nice pool integrated in the scenery of the jungle, great bird watching, monkeys in trees around, highly recommend it if you go visit Tikal, which by itself is a must see!"
50,"We spent one night there as we explored Tikal.  We stayed in a standard room with king bed.  We were very impressed with the cleanliness and condition of the room, and we greatly appreciated the special touches it had for our honeymoon.  It had a nice lounge area with wifi where we could cool off after exploring the sites.  We also had dinner and brunch at its restaurant, which were great.  Our one disappointment was that we had no hot water for the shower. We arranged a sunset tour through the lodge when we arrived.  We had a great guide and would recommend this tour if the weather permits. We went into the park on our own the next morning at 6 AM and enjoyed the park in peace before the large tour groups arrived.  We're glad we spent a night at the park instead of just doing a"
50,"We stayed at Hotel Jungle Lodge Tikal this month and were so pleased!  I was wondering about a stay in the National Park jungle, and I am so glad we did it.  It is beautiful, modern, super clean, and so refreshing.  Lush foliage creates a natural experience of sights, sounds, and quiet.  Be aware there is no A/C, and occasionally there is no hot water.  The electricity is on only at certain times, but this was never a problem.  You always have one light and fan available.  Internet is available in the Lodge, and it is fast.    People there were friendly and spoke English.  Restaurant is a lovely open air place with really good food.  We had the best tour guide ever for our sunrise tour of Tikal.  They packed our breakfast and took us places unavailable to the public.  You need a"
40,"Honestly, If it wasn't for the completely perfect location, I would have given this place three stars.  First of all Tikal is fabulous.  Being in the jungle location couldn't be better.  The howlers may wake you up a couple of times a night, but that is what the jungle is all about.  I had one main problem with the room.  The beds - they are not good at all.  We stayed two nights and our room had two beds.  After the first night we moved to the other bed.  Both were quite lousy.  The other issue we had was with the restaurant and doesn't reflect on my star rating.  Don't pay without seeing a bill.  The first meal we had the waiter brought us a calculator to show us the amount.  I knew it was too high, but I didn't know if there was a service fee or tax added.  After paying, I"
50,"We only had a one night stay planned here: we would definitely spend more time here on future visits.  We did not find an internet connection, even in the restaurant next to the router! Probably one of the best things that could happen...could concentrate more on the fabulous environment we were in. Yes, the electricity was intermittent...not a concern for us. The meals were excellent, staff helpful and friendly....would return here in a heartbeat! The guide from the hotel was perfect...we had a tour in the daytime as well as a sunset tour...learned a great deal from this man."
50,"Tikal Inn was a great place to stay while visiting Tikal.  They picked us up at the airport and helped us with all of our needs during our stay.  They set us up with English speaking tour guides for birding, a Sunrise tour and an Archaeological tour.  We would recommend all three things.  All of our tour guides were great, but we especially enjoyed our time with Ronald.  He was very knowledgeable and entertaining.  It was great to get to know him. We enjoyed the food at the hotel and the wait staff was fantastic.  Good at their job while being personable and fun.  Because we stayed three nights we did try out some other places as well that were also solid.  I know some people mention the lack of electricity during certain hours.  This did not hinder our experience at all and was"
50,"I want to thank all the staff of that wonderful hotel for my 3 night stay in March. I showed up at the hotel having just gotten food poisoning from my previous location, and I couldn’t have landed in a better place with better people.   The staff was incredible, and offered the best service despite my attenuated circumstances. They nursed me back to health with their excellent food, and the maître d’hôtel was a calm, accommodating, friendly presence throughout. He never missed an opportunity to come see how I was doing, or ask if there was anything he could do to help.   My planned 2 nights turned into 3, as I found a home among the thick jungle of Guatemala. I even saw a juvenile jaguar only 100 metres from my accommodation on my last night.  The other reviews are corrected in"
30,"I looked at the bad reviews for this hotel and thought this is from people who are not familiar with this kind of travel or place. Maybe they were on a type of packaged tour, as all the complaints seem to be about no electric and it being hot.   As it is in the middle of a Central American jungle you’d expect it to be hot and on the hotel’s website it clearly states the hours when there is electric and Internet, they are up front about it.  Also those bad reviews are not recent.   I read in a recent review or on the hotels website that the hotel has new management.   It is a lot cheaper than the other options here, so I decided to stay there and did the meal package, which also seems to have lots of complaints. This isn’t a top restaurant in some trendy location. I feel sorry"
50,"We had a great stay at the Tikal Inn. We made a mistake with our booking dates and they were so helpful and accommodating.  That level of service only continued when we arrived.  It was clear the owners/managers are proud of their hotel, and the national park and were happy to give us advice and tips.  Rooms were clean, grounds were lovely and the pool was just what we needed on a hot afternoon.  That and watching monkeys swing through the trees! It is a (very) short walk to the entrance to the ruins, and there is a great path if you want to walk back into the jungle. People should know that wifi is only available in the main building, hot water is limited and electricity is only available at certain times of the day.  Personally, we thought that was part of the charm.  Overall"
50,"This was one of the highlights of our trip! What a fantastic place to stay. The room was spotless (no bugs or spiders as some other posts had indicated) and comfortable. We loved the privacy from our room and deck and that we got to wake up to the sound of the jungle every morning.   There is not a lot of sound proofing as the windows are a screen so you can hear the restaurant and late arrivals but it is well worth it for the airflow and waking up to the sound of birds and howler monkeys!  The restaurant is beautiful, the staff are lovely and the food is okay. We spend 3 days at the lodge and by the end I was a little tired of the menu. That being said it is amazing the menu is so large and food is as good as it is given the location...I mean you are right in the jungle!  The"
50,"We LOVED our stay at the Jungle Lodge. The surroundings are beautiful, the people are unbelievably friendly, and the room was amazing. We felt incredibly lucky to be staying at such a beautiful location. The bed was great too and the toiletries smelled amazing. Only downside was the poor water pressure in the shower, but one cannot have everything. If you have the chance to stay at this hostal or the hotel - go for it! We had a room with a private bathroom. If you are staying here, book the sunrise tour with Tony as your guide. You will beat the crowd from Flores and will have a quiet moment before the big group from Flores comes in and everyone in that group starts unpacking their backpacks noisily (We personally felt the number or people on the temple should be restricted and"
20,"The obvious pro is that this place is right next to the entrance to Tikal.  Rooms are decently appointed.  Bathrooms are clean if you’re the first to use it after housekeeping otherwise the other guests are quite dirty.    They don’t seem to check emails after 5pm so I had to pay extra to arrange private transport the next day.    Then they gave me the worst room right next to the restaurant, when I checked in relatively early.  You will not get any peace and quiet until after 11pm.  You won’t get soothing jungle noises, all you’ll get are loud Europeans talking at dinner.    Again this seems to be a common theme in Guatemala, that Asian travelers like me are discriminated against in terms of room assignment. "
50,"So exiting to wake up in the middle of the night to roars of howler monkeys, First thought it was jaguars before heart rate returned to normal. Really great tours with great guides. Clean and nice establishment, Very friendly and helpful staff. Good drinks and food. Only bad was getting an extra lunch by some other guest on our tab. It was finally solved, but unneccessary. Suggest they start to ask to see room key before registering tabs. Anyway, we strongly recommend staying here, lovely place!"
50,"Jungle Lodge Hotel ( and their remarkably clean hostel) is the only hotel in Tikal National Park. The casita was elegant, extraordinarily clean with great beds. The food is good and priced reasonably in the restaurant. They arranged English-speaking guides for an architecture and a sunrise tour of Tikal. The best way to communicate with front desk is by PM on their Facebook page."
40,"We had a very pleasant stay at hotel Jaguar Inn in Tikal! 4 of us were travelling together and booked one of their bigger rooms which was great! The check in was easy and the front desk person spoke great English and was quick to check us in. The fan was enough to keep us cool enough at night and I slept well. The room was clean but the top comforter looked worn and maybe as if it hadn't been washed in a while - but hey, you're in the jungle in Guatemala about to see one of the coolest ruins on Earth! We had hot water for our shower and power whenever we needed it in our room. Wifi was available when the restaurant was open if you needed to use it. I was very impressed by the restaurant and had some great food there and loved eating outside after dark by candle light. It was a"
40,"We stayed at the Jaguar Inn for two nights in mid November and it was great. The hotel was very quiet as it was the beginning of high season. We got a room with a king size bed, mosquito nets on each window (remember it's a Dengue and Zika mosquito zone!) and a basic but perfect working toilet. Every room has a little terrace with an hammock, perfect to relax after a long walk while you listen to all the birds and howler monkeys. We even saw a toucan from our room! The hotel is right next to the entrance of the park so it's very convenient if you want to visit the archeological site. We did the day tour and the sunrise tour thought the hotel and the guide, Obdulio, was superb! He used to be a Tikal park ranger before being a tour guide so he's the guy for the job!"
30,"We were looking for a hotel very close to the Tikal archeological site entrance, and this is it! It’s just a minute walk from it. On top the hotel is nice and clean, but the room was very basic (big window overlooking the common garden without lace curtains, no decoration at all, furniture not very well maintained). Premises are nice and the restaurant is very good. However the beast by far is the staff, all of them have been helpful and extremely nice."
10,We stayed here for one night to enter the park very early. The room smelled bad and wasn't clean. Shower was cold all the time. The interior was really unloving. It' s much too overpriced. The hotel is run down. The staff is friendly. 
50,Very nice setup in the middle of the jungle.  Rooms where nice and well kept.  Internet was slow and available for free until 8:00 pm.  At 8:00 pm power plant is shut down and they have a very well run battery back up system that powers light and ceiling fans.  Overall a very nice place if your plan is to take the sunrise tour of Tikal
50,"Chanceux du guidage de Bélinda De la belle journée pas trop chaude  Du peu de monde sur le site ( bien qu'il soit très visité) SITE EXTRAORDINAIRE  Chanceux d'avoir vu les singes hurleurs, atèles, un oiseau de la famille du quetzal, le pic-vert etc....Les tsillandias , les orchidées etc....

20,"Hatten unsere eigenen Hängematten dabei, deshalb war es sehr preiswert. Die Lage  auch sehr schön und die Ausstattung ausreichend. Nur hatten wir das Pech, dass in der selben Nacht eine Gruppe von über 20 Einheimischen inkl Kindern dort ein Familienfest abhielten. Sie waren alle samt die GANZE Nacht über so unverschämt laut, dass wir kein Auge zubekamen. Der Platzwächter hatte zuvor noch behauptet er wäre nachts auch anwesend, doch dem war nicht so. Wir wurden mit dem Problem komplett alleine gelassen. Zudem mussten wir ihn am Tag der Abreise über 20Minuten lang suchen weil er irgenwo am Biertrinken saß, weshalb wir fast ubseren Bus verpassten."
50,"J’ai fait la visite du site de Tikal avec Fernando, guide parlant le français. De manière très intelligente, il m’a fait faire le tour du site à l’envers et par des petits chemins de travers, ainsi, aucun touriste, que la nature et les animaux, singes hurleurs, oiseaux, magnifique jungle, il avait une très grande connaissance des arbres et de la médecine  Traditionnelle. 4h de balade très intéressante."
50,"«Тикаль» расположен в 495 км от Гватемалы и всего в 64 км от Флореса.  Первые исследования заброшенных руин начались в конце XIX в., но только с 1955 г. они приняли систематический характер. В этом же году «Тикаль» объявили национальным парком, хотя ранее, в 1931 г., его признали Национальным гватемальским памятником. Национальный парк «Тикаль» в 1979 г. был включен в Список Всемирного культурного наследия ЮНЕСКО. Центр Тикаля — большая площадь Гранд-Плаза. С восточной и западной её стороны, возвышаются две пирамиды. К двум храмам на самых верхних площадках пирамид, которые в современный период назвали храмом Великого Ягуара и храмом Масок, ведут крутые каменные ступени.  Это место впечатляет своей красотой и величественностью сооружений , прогулка здесь не оставит равнодушным"
10,"Que lastima que las instalaciones de los baños estén en pésimas condiciones, el encargado tiene todo muy limpio, pero las regaderas no tienen manerales, no tienen la regadera, no hay espejo, las puertas no funcionan, no hay luz.  Lo peor es que te cobran y te dicen que todo está en buenas condiciones.  Muy mal para la administración del parque!"
20,"This place may be spoiled by the tourists, my sense the service here was not matching the amazing location and the price. Most of the waiters didn't speak English thus we had problem on orders, and finally paid more due to communications. The path to the bungalows was quite hard for ladies and old people carrying cases, so many staffs in lobby but no one gave a hand. The bed was quite doubtful,we found insects at the first sight, and afterwards all of us were bothered by louses."
30,"This is a really good hotel next to the Mayan ruins at Tikal. The accommodation is excellent, with individual chalets apart from the main building. However, the hotel is run on an American basis. The restaurant has variable service; evening meals are generally very good and a reasonable price, but breakfasts were a farce.  Service was very slow, despite there being very few customers and the American breakfast was rubbery scrambled eggs and a few small pieces of what we finally decided was bacon, although it looked more like deep fried prawns! The breakfast came in dribs and drabs, with toast coming first, followed by the eggs and bacon, with a pot of jam (jelly), followed about 15 minutes later by fruit juice.. Pity about the restaurant service, because this could be a really"
50,Very nice Lodge to stay at while visiting Tical. We stayed in the hostel part of the lodge. Actually found this to be the most luxury hostel I ever stayed in. Beautiful clean room with fan and mosquito net. The bathrooms were like 4 star hotel bathrooms. Hard to Belize. After exploring the ruins you can relax at the bar pool with loungers and free towels. I found the restaurant very good. The food tasty and large portions àt a reasonable price. Caution don't take the sunrise tour unless you know there will be clear skies. We knew it would be cloudy but they told us it is still awesome to see. Well it's not. After an hour walking in the dark we were seated at the top of the pyrimid. Not only was it cloudy it was also foggy. We saw nothing by daylight.
50,"Great hotel in the middle of the jungle. WAke up with  the rest of the jungle. Go with guide Cesar for the Sunset tour, your mind will be blown away. I will never forget this! Go and see for yourself. Ask die Cesar.             "
50,"We (my parents, my husband and myself) had a wonderful stay in the Jungle Lodge. It is clean, comfortable and the garden is beautiful. The highlight of our trip was a great sunrise tour of Tikal by Cesar. My husband and I live in Central America and have visited many different Mayan sites over the years. Cesar was the best tour guide we’ve had. He is not only very knowledgeable, he also makes you dream, imagine and wonder about life that once was in the Mayan world."
50,"I went there with my husband and our 2 kids. Our room was beautiful, quiet and clean. The feeling of seeing nothing but the jungle is breathtaking. The service was great and the food was delicious. Overall a great experience."
50,"What a fantastic experience! Our cabin was so clean and right next to the main building, restaurant, and beautiful pool.   We selected the sunrise hike through the jungle and ruins. We bought our tickets the night before when we entered the park. Hold off on paying for a tour guide, which can be scheduled at the lodge.  Tony-the owner of the lodge- does the sunrise tour every morning. He was a fantastic guide with so much insight about the history of the sites. He shared stories from his time spent in Tikal at the archeological sites.   I recommend the lodge and the tour to anyone passing by or through Tikal!  We flew in to Belize City and went to Tikal specifically to see the ruins and experience the jungle. It was amazing."
40,"My boyfriend and I stayed at Jungle Lodge Tikal for one night. It's such an amazing experience! The hotel, restaurant and staff are great! It's a fantastic place in the jungle.  We would definitely recommend a sunrise tour with Tony! Even though it was too cloudy for a sunrise, it still was the most amazing tour! Tony has so much knowledge, and he's lovely to listen to. Don't miss out on this one 😉"
40,"We had the best time here at the lodge, everyone was kind and very accommodating. We especially loved our tour guide Toni who took us on a sunrise tour through the ruins. He is absolutely amazing and full of so many facts.   The food at the lodge was pretty good but slightly expensive for backpackers but in saying that their isn’t many places within the park to eat.  The lodges surroundings are stunning and we saw to many birds and monkeys. It also had a huge swimming pool, mini cinema that always showed documentaries.  "
40,"Clean and contemporary, Tikal's Jungle Lodge is a great place to be for visiting the National Park and seeing the extraordinary archaeological site. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The recent renovation is very well done. Details are finished to a high level of  craftsmanship. Though more boutique in character than luxurious, the rooms are very comfortable and there are plenty of amenities (game room, movie theater, swimming pool) to give families ways to relax after viewing the Mayan temples. The restaurant serves breakfast, lunch and dinner with a broad selection of cuisines, the local Petén dishes being our favorites. Try the Chiltepe Steak. It is marvelous. Reservations are handled by third parties at the moment. Adding reservations to their website would be a"
50,"We were not expecting a lot based on some reviews but we enjoyed our stay. The room is basic but we had no complaints. The food in the restaurant was great, the service was very good. Shout out to our waiter: Pablo - lovely guy."
40,"Finally a place that is honest about their strengths and limitations.   They’re in the park so the facilities are basic. The staff are very helpful and several speak more than one language.   The power goes out at 8pm so be prepared for that and there are various times in the day when water isn’t available. This is all explained clearly when you arrive though. There is some WiFi for a bit in the day, but it’s only strong enough for text messages, don’t get your hopes up for anything more.   You’re kind of stuck with eating at the hotel restaurant as it’s so remote but that’s ok, all the food we had was fine. Breakfast doesn’t start until 7am which is a bit of a shame as the park opens at 6am. That’s just something to be aware of. "
40,"The Jaguar Inn and two other hotels are the only ones in the park right near to the Tikal ruins, so they have a monopoly and need not try too hard. They charge as much as most good hotels but don't offer the amenities. Yes, there are specific times that the electricity and water are turned off (in mid-morning, mid-afternoon, and all night). I understand that it's saving energy, but I would fill the plastic garbage can with water just in case my lady or I had to flush in the night. Because of this lack of consistent power, there are no fridges in the rooms either. The rooms are comfortable, at least more comfortable than the tenting, which is also available, but ours didn't get cleaned until later in the day. It was surprisingly chilly at night, but when the howler monkeys"
30,"The rooms are nice, electricity (and thus water pressure) is restricted but not a big deal.  The restaurant is lacking in variety and flavor.  No coffee early AM so you have to fend for yourself. They provide you with a plastic cup of drinking water and you have to buy more water in plastic bottles.  They have no desire to offer water to refill your own bottle....not even for a charge. This is the tropics folks.....and water is a necessity....I find it unacceptable not to provide drinking water for your guests, especially considering the remote location!!!!!"
50,Just in the middle of a 2 night stay ! Perfect ! If you stay here you must embrace the location and that you are staying in the national park If you want a 5*hotel then stay in the city .. The hotel management and staff are most helpful .  Ignore any negatives about the food ! Perfectly acceptable cuisine . Great GNT in hot countries you would expect problems on the Vino front due to storage however no problems here perfect !  Now a few items you need to know !! It is impossible to buy and entrance ticket from the entrance here you can only buy from actual park fare 17k away so buy as you pass through ! You need you passport too   However the manager helped me as I wanted a second days pass and will send a bike to the gate on your behalf for 50quetzals  Transport ! Back to
50,I loved our relaxing stay at Tikal Inn.  The rooms and grounds were clean and immaculate.  The pool was wonderful. The hotel is a 3 min walk to the entry to Tikal.  Best of all Ricardo and his sister Roxy were so helpful and friendly. Roxy drove my family and another traveller to Remate (she was running errands that day and it was on her way) to our connecting microbus and told such amazing snake stories!  Ricardo gave us lots of info and really made us feel like such welcome guests.  Great stay.
50,"Absolutely delightful hotel with beautiful grounds. If you are lucky to get one of the rooms next to the pool you are in for a treat. After a day walking around Tikal this is a sanctuary to return to with such a lovely pool and friendly, helpful staff. In addition they do a great Pina Colada!"
40,"Everything was fine about the hotel and I don’t understand the complaints.  I had a more distant room which was cheaper but I liked it because there were so few people around and it was quieter. Apparently there had been a jaguar cub hanging around the hotel recently but I wasn’t lucky enough to see it. I enjoyed the birds and howler monkeys. The only time that limited electricity was a problem was when I used up my phone battery taking photos and suddenly realized I couldn’t recharge it in the hotel.  I travel a lot in Guate and services around Tikal have a “pressure the tourist” vibe that I’m not used to. I got a room for $67 US (tax included). On check in I was offered a package with the sunrise tour,  dinner and breakfast. I was too tired to shop around and I probably should"
40,"This was a great in the jungle. And remember that, you are in the jungle. The stay here was made great because of the manager, Ricardo. He was soooo helpful with absolutely anything we needed. From tours, to highlights around the area, to getting us transportation back to the airport. He belongs in a Four Seasons somewhere!  The hotel and rooms are nice. We went with the bungalow, which is more, but worth it. Wifi was ok, but its the jungle, so expected. Electricity wasn't on all day, only mornings and evenings, but most of the time we were at Tikal so didn't matter to us.  The pool is refreshing for when you come back from your hikes. The food in the restaurant is ok. Nothing special. The mixed drinks were really good though! There are also drinks and snacks you can purchase"
40,"My husband and I stayed at the Tikal Inn for two days, while we visited the Tikal Ruins. We were greeted by Ricardo, who really went above and beyond, to make sure we were well-informed and that our stay at the Inn was pleasant. We speak very little Spanish, so we were lucky that Ricardo’s English was perfect and that he was so eager to help and knowledgeable of Tikal.   We booked a poolside Bungalow, and we found it to be clean and comfortable. Our room had a hot shower, large soft towels, mosquito nets and fresh bedding. I think the thing people need to keep in mind is that we are in the middle of the jungle...there will be internet outages (it’s satellite) and times during the day where you don’t have power. If this is an issue for you, book yourself a trip to Miami, not to a"
30,The main advantage of this lodge is its proximity to Tikal. The rooms are nice and comfortable. The food is rather ordinary. The people at the front desk are not particularly smily.  This is a place to spend one night and go back to Flores. There is not much more to do than to visit the park.
40,"Arriving in the evening, we had a warm welcome and the room was ready for us. We booked a standard room which was of sufficient size for two pax with carry-on luggage. The bathroom is large enough with a comfortable shower and hot water at all times. Overall great value for the money you pay and we didn’t opt for luxury in the middle of the jungle for our one-night stay, even though the hotel offers way much larger rooms.  The restaurant offers a mix of international and regional dishes of solid quality to please everyone’s taste; service is very friendly and efficient.   Jungle Lodge also helps arranging tours and guides, so we booked the sunrise tour with them, which turned out to be one of the most impressive experiences during our honeymoon trip."
50,"Everything was great, the rooms and bathrooms were very nice and clean. The property is beautiful, immaculately landscaped and fits perfectly in the jungle environment where it is set.   The restaurant is very nice, our food was delicious for both dinner and breakfast, and it was not overpriced for a resort of that type.   The only thing this hotel failed at was timely email communication about important things like arranging transport and tours. However, for transfers to and from the hotel and a great private tour into the ruins of Tikal, we ended up using Elmer at Tikal VIP Tours and his services were stellar. I would highly recommend. His agency has a profile here on TA.   The best part of our short stay really was the wonderful staff at the restaurant who was so cordial,"
40,If you want to get into Tikal early this is the perfect location at the gates which open at 6am. They organised excellent breakfast box which we ate on our own in Tikal grand plaza at dawn. Magical! Rooms just fine and restaurant better than many said. Pool great for birdwatching and spider monkeys swinging through the trees 
40,"Given that you are in the middle of the jungle, the Jungle Lodge Hotel does well on almost all fronts. We had a small room cabin and found it satisfactory for our family of three. The room was clean, beds comfortable and facilities of a good standard. Electricity (via generator) is switched on and off throughout day and night at scheduled times, but a ceiling fan continues to be powered 24/7. The hot water supply is variable and, I suspect, reflects demand.  The public spaces are good, a games room provided plenty of entertainment for us all. The pool is small but great for cooling off and refreshing yourself after a tour of the park. Wifi is available in public spaces and around the pool only. It's patchy and slow, but not unexpected.  The restaurant was better in the evening"
50,"Me and my girl gang managed to get the best guide on the block to tour the park. He spoke both fluent english and spanish and knew the rich cultural history of the site as well as had knowledge about the local flora and fauna. I was astonished by his breadth of knowledge!! I even took some notes. The park itself was fantastic, there are rules for aircraft and  drones placed to protect wildlife with is totally rad. I would definitely return here! "
30,"We stayed in hammocks the night before visiting the ruins. It was difficult finding enough info about how to do it, you can't book in advance. Turned out to be more expensive than we expected. 50Q to stay at campsite, then 50Q to hire a hammock each (70Q for a tent). It was a cool experience with the howler monkeys all night, but difficult to sleep. It was great to wake up and go straight into the park with hardly anyone around. Facilities are basic, but what do you expect when camping in the jungle?!"
50,"Visiting during the rainy season ensures that there are fewer people in the park which makes the experience more enjoyable. Also, try the sunrise tour, it's wonderful to see the sun rising above the jungle canopy. Truly a wonderful place."
40,"We were staying in Belize, rented a car from Crystal car rentals and took a day trip to Tikal. It was a nice drive - roaders were not bad and GPS worked well.  At Tikal it was a lot of walking up and down all the ruins. We had went hiking the day before so we were a already worn out but the view was breath taking. If I were togo back I would make sure to rest up the day before and it would be nice to try the hotel the have in the park - to wake up at sunrise and see everything. "
40,The camp-site offers basic accommodation and amenities. The camping ticket must be bought at the National park entrance for Q50 then another Q50 if you need to rent hammock. There is no safe drinking water but there is “comedor” to buy and have a basic stuff to survive. The big adventure is that you are on of the first to enter the ruins experience something unusual.
50,"We stayed here for one night on our recent visit to the ruins. Located inside the National Park, this jungle lodge has a perfect location.  The rooms have a bed and a ceiling fan and some shelves and mosquito net. Very clean rooms and no complaints there. The common bathrooms are also well maintained. The electricity is switched off certain times of the day and the internet is available only in the common areas.  The staff are extremely friendly  and attentive. There are plenty of vegetarian options for food and they are all good.  There is plenty of wildlife to be seen around the property - toucans , agouti, howler monkeys and lots more birds if one keeps a lookout.  We definitely enjoyed our stay here and will highly recommend."
40,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the jungle lodge. It is set in a lush jungle and it’s main draw is how close it is to Tikal (which by the way is absolutely magical!). We were welcomed by excellent staff on the front desk who were very helpful and organised our tours and taxis. The food is fine (pasta was delicious) and the bathrooms are clean and spacious. The room is all you need it to be although the bed does feel small if you’re used to King sizes. The pool at the lodge is gorgeous and you can hear the animals and birds while lounging but my personal highlight of our stay was the family of howler monkeys outside the room (although they are loud!). It was wonderful to be so close to nature. I would highly recommend this lodge if you wish to visit Tikal.
50,We stayed here 3 nights and found plenty to do. Meals are very good and bar is lovely.  Room 19 is clean and large with a ceiling fan that runs all night! Car rental from airport is very reasonable. Don’t drive at night tho. 
50,"Excellent hostel offering same comfort as the hotel. It worth the price without a doubt since sleeping in the park allows you to get in into Tikal at 4am or 6am... without anyone else than you... just magical. Must buy your ticket in advance, before arriving at the hotel. If you don't have your ticket you will have to go back outside the park to buy it and come back inside the park.... 30km!!! Food ok, you have nice and cheap options near the hotel as well. You will sleep with forest and wild animals noises... fabulous!"
50,"The location is incredible for wildlife - we saw a troop of Howler Monkeys less than a hundred feet from our room, Coati, Ocellated Turkey, Parrots, and many other birds. The grounds are beautiful and well maintained. We believe this is the best place to stay in the area. We had walked to the neighboring lodges, which made us appreciate the Jungle Lodge even more. Not to mention, the price is great Make sure you exchange currency in advance to pay admission for the park (purchased on your way to the lodge) and if you would like to purchase souvenirs (available just outside of the grounds to the lodge).  Note: Gratuity is already included in bill at restaurant, although stated in Spanish (We accidentally tipped twice).  You may want to bring earplugs, half of the hostals are"
50,"This place deserves every star it can get. It is conveniently located right in the heart of the park just a few steps from the gateway to the ruins. It is a family owned business run by staff that are kind and considerate as it comes. One must know before you go, that at all 3 hotels in Tikal park that electricity and wifi is limited, as you are literally in the heart of the jungle. I didn't know any of this going into it, as I just arrived on a whim for a few nights stay. Upon arrival, I discovered how wonderful their concierge was and chose to book an all inclusive food and tour package - the sunset tour, the sunrise tour and the archeological tour. I never do this, but I was so impressed by how welcoming they were that I just decided to go for it, and it was worth every"
40,"Nice sized bungalows, good food and drinks in the restaurant, relaxing pool, friendly staff, and very conveniently located near the ruins.  A lot of wildlife and birds all around with howler monkeys up in the treetops.  Limited electrical at night and mornings and weak WiFi, with occasional hot water."
40,Stayed at the Tikal inn and it was comfortable and really friendly.  We were up to see the sunrise at 04:00 and the coffee was made and waiting for us.... bottom line it’s a great place to stay if you want to explore the ruins.... take a guide it’s well worth it.
50,"We knew that electricity was available only a few times a day and that wi-fi was spotty.  This is easily discoverable by reading reviews and considering where one is.  This is true of all three inns in Tikal, so I personally do not understand anyone removing stars for this.  We were very happy with our accommodations and pleased to find out that it was only a few steps further away from the park than the other inns.  The map made it look as if it were much further away.  It was a short, easy walk to the park, even for me with recent foot surgery  We personally found the food to be great, especially the chicken burrito and breakfast.  We did not hire a guide for Tikal and spent two days (walking 15 miles) covering the site.  We did use Andres to tour Uaxactún.  We had the site"
40,Other people have commented on the limited Wi-Fi and limited electricity— so give yourself the time to sink into this world apart We had two days and wished we had three . Roxy is terrific and try to book a private tour with her. We thoroughly enjoyed Andress and his archaeological tour. It was well paste to really take in and appreciate the surroundings and have access to him to ask questions. He was knowledgeable and gracious. We ended up eating our dinners in the restaurant and enjoyed the convenience and the solidly good food and drink. We did use the pool one day and enjoyed a break there. Try to book one of the cottages although we were in the furthest building and still enjoyed our stay. Nothing will prepare you for the roar of the howler monkeys towards Dawn!
50,"Cesar gave us an incredible tour of the park at sunset. Super knowledgable guide. It is worth staying here so you can have access to guides like him. You will learn a ton about Mayan history, government, philosophy, religion, etc."
10,"We came for the sake of park and tours. Really poor tours. Cesar was a terrible guide, who was leaving tourists at night in the jungles if they are not as fast as he is (he was walking at a crazy pace). Jungles have jaguars, pumas, crocodiles and poisonous snakes but he didn't care if someone get lost or attacked. The tour itself was a combination of a few Wikipedia facts mixed with Dan Brown conspiracy theories (I'm not joking, the guy was telling unproven , anti-scientific BS). Moreover, he was rude both with the tourists and the locals (e.g., ruined a local religious ceremony by his stupid Instagram selfie video and flash). Moreover, 2 different tours (sunrise and sunset) we're almost identical.  In addition, if you're late for 1 min they go without you but than can spend 40"
30,"The accommodation was superb, the staff mostly helpful and friendly.  The only really big downside was the quality of the food served in the hotel’s restaurant and that there weren’t any other better alternatives at other places.  We’ve been now almost a month in Guatemala and the food was by far the worst we came across during that time.  We talked to a lot of fellow travellers who thought exactly the same. Very disappointing for a hotel in this price class."
50,We loved our stay at the Jungle Lodge. The location can not be beat for exploring Tikal - especially if you are doing the sunrise hike. The rooms were great and comfortable and the pool was lovely - with spider monkeys and toucans visiting us in the trees each afternoon.
40,"We stayed in one of the Junior Suites at the Jungle Lodge Hotel for two nights and really loved it. Our room was immaculately clean, and the bed was super comfortable. I had 2 of the best night's sleeps that I had gotten in a while. The room was surprisingly pretty upscale considering the location in the middle of nowhere. Out of the three hotels in the park, this one is definitely the upscale option. (There is a mid-range option and a budget option from the other two.)  As others have mentioned, there is no electricity in Tikal National Park and all of the hotels are run by generators. Therefore, electricity is only on at certain times during the day. We knew this prior to our arrival so we were prepared for this, but it seems like not everyone is aware of this. Definitely keep"
50,"Clean, modern, compact rooms. Electricity only runs for selected hours of the day (so plan around that), although the ceiling fan in the room runs 24 hours (and seemingly (at least in my room) if you run the fan the ceiling light will also work). I’ve reached an age where I generally say no to shared bathrooms, however the shared bathrooms at the Jungle Lodge were modern, spacious and kept impeccably clean.  Didn’t try the restaurant as I was recovering from some earlier food ‘upsets’ while I was visiting, but  the food I did see there looked delicious.  Highly recommended. "
40,"This is a good-looking hotel in a great location. We had a very pleasant family stay here. Each little (half a) casita per 2/3 had a pleasant balcony and felt secluded but was very close to a lovely pool and pretty dining area. There was a general feeling that it has huge potential but didn't yet tick all high end boxes. Electricity was only available at certain times, tricky for anyone elderly. WiFi was only in public areas. We'd asked  a month in advance for gluten-free bread for a coeliac but there wasn't any although there was always a gluten-free free (fruit) breakfast option and done g-f dinner possibilities. We got there on the local bus from Flores and really loved Edy, one of the drivers who went out of his way to help  us get cheap tickets for buses and very"
40,I was really surprised as I thought this would be just your average hostel. When we booked they only had a twin room left but we really wanted to stay close to Tikal so we went for it but when we arrived and asked if it was possible to get a double room they said no problem and there was no extra fee for it. The room was quite stylish and although there was no aircon it stayed cool during the night. The shared bathroom was really clean and had loads of hot water which you really need after a long hot day climbing ruins. We took a dip in the pool at night (it stays open until 10pm) but sadly there was no lights inside the pool so we swam into some of the in-water-seats a few times. The wifi is restricted to the restaurant and reception area but we felt that was ok. They also have
50,"The hostel is the ""lower"" budget version of the Jungle Lodge Hotel. It's located on the same premises next to the restaurant. It's perfect for early morning tours, since it is practically inside the national park. Our room was clean and quiet with a comfortable bed, a mosquito net and equipped with a good ceiling fan. The shared bathrooms were modern, very clean and with plenty toilet paper. You can spot ocellated turkeys, guans or hummingbirds while sitting on the terrace in front of your bedroom or listen to howler monkeys, while reading a book. Just perfect for nature/animal lovers.  The employees were friendly and spoke good English. The food at the restaurant was quite good. WiFi only worked in the restaurant and reception area, but that wasn't a problem for us. The whole"
40,"Really enjoyed our stay, the site is beautiful, you can see toucans, hummingbirds, and monkeys.  The pool was great as a break from the heat. There are trails from the lodge that take us right to the site. Food at the restaurant is very good, international dishes but with a Guatemalan flavor! Very friendly staff."
50,"It is one of the largest archaeological sites and urban centers of the pre-Columbian Maya civilization. It is located in the archaeological region of the Petén Basin in what is now northern Guatemala.  The ruins lie among the tropical rain forests of northern Guatemala that formed the cradle of lowland Maya civilization. There are thousands of ancient structures at Tikal and only a fraction of these have been excavated, after decades of archaeological work."
50,"un lieu chargé de mystères et d'histoire, une longue marche avant d'accéder à la cité perdue. Des monuments dégagés, d'autres encore envahis par la végétation luxuriante , le chant des oiseaux, quelques cris d'animaux tapis et invisibles, une guide érudite et fort sympathique ; la magie s'opère et on est transporté au temps des mayas "
50,"Camping at Tikal was part if our group tour and not something I would necessarily have booked myself. However I'm glad we did as it is pretty cool! The tents are a reasonable size and came with all the bedding needed. You need a torch, especially if you need the loo in the night. Yes the block with shower and toilets is basic but this is a campsite in central America- not sure what people were expecting? Have had similar in Europe. There is a restaurant within walking distance across the gravelled area; go here for food and more luxurious toilet experience! You are only here once - be at one with nature! Some people in our group found the insects or their fear of them overwhelming. I thoroughly enjoyed myself and slept well!"
40,We opted to stay in campground at Tikal (This is the basic camping and cheapest option on site)  Myself and my girlfriend have quite divergent views on it which I think reflects people’s comments here You need camping ticket bought at gate one (extra 50q pp)  You can’t book it  We weren’t exactly prepared for it  You get your camping tickets validated at main ticket entrance to park  (Locals will point you in direction of site which is very near entrance )  Then a guard will check your ticket and you have option to rent a tent or hammock from him  Tent was 100q for night (for both us)  Hammock 50 q  Tents are erected on cement which is under a large thatched area (Not super authentic but I was happy we were gonna be dry)  He will make it up for you and give you a matt He didn’t
50,"We rented a tent for 100qs. We were happy to pay it as the guard was very friendly and put it up straight away. We chose not to use the facilities onsite but had a beer at a nearby bar to use wifi and bathroom. Throughout the night we heard howler monkeys and birds and could definitely feel that the wildlife was close. We chose to stay there to get into the park just before 6. We figured it was more economical than paying for a tour as it was so misty in the morning you couldn't really see anything until after 7 anyway, which gave us time to get all the way to Templo 4. A great experience overall."
40,"Spent two nights here with our teenagers. Great location next to the entrance to Tikal which allowed us to easily head into the park for four hours in the morning, head back to the hotel for a few hours during the hottest and busiest part of the day and then head back. Meal options at the restaurant were various enough to keep us happy for our brief stay. Prices were on par with what we’d been paying all over Belize anyways. Room was clean and well taken care of.   Only issue was the noisy tour group assembling at 4 am for a sunrise tour who seemed to have no consideration at all for other guests. Not really the fault of the hotel but would be nice if there was space for groups to assemble further away from the guest rooms."
50,"Knowing this hotel is off the grid, I was expecting a much more basic and rustic accommodation. I was pleasantly surprised by how nice the place is. Spacious room, hot shower, large vanity, clean sheets, and a king-size bed. All this in the jungle? Unbelievable. I imagine it's logistically challenging to build and equip such a place in this rural part of Guatemala, so the price seems reasonable to me.  As one of the few hotels within the Tikal National Park, this is the perfect location to stay if you want to do the 4 AM sunrise tour.  Sure, the electricity and hot water are available only during limited hours, and there's no fancy lotion or plush bathrobe, but we come here for nature and not luxury, right? Wifi is available only in the lobby/restaurant, and even there it's"
40,"We booked a family room (four of us).  The ambiance is great for a jungle visit.  You can also rent tents for a more intimate nature experience.  My wife does not like bugs, so we opted for the rooms. If you have tents, they have communal showers and bathrooms and wash areas.  Rooms have en-suite facilities.    The place is very clean and well managed.  The electricity in the reception goes off at 9PM.  We arrived at 8pm, but management said that we could get settled and they would keep the kitchen open for a meal and helped us get settled.   Very nice.     Hot water is from 0600 to 0900 and from 1800 to 2100; daily.    My daughter suffers from ciliac disease  (no gluten) and the kitchen was able to accommodate her perfectly for a packed breakfast (sunrise in Tikal National"
40,"my experience is fair here. The hotel does not have the best information regarding the transportation back to Flores. However the location is unbeatable. Good to stay for a night and visit Tikal early. The limited timing for electricity is a little inconvenient, but understandable."
30,"This hotel is in the jungle so expectations should be as such.  There will be bugs in the rooms, wifi will be spotty.  The rooms were clean / plain / simple.  This is a few steps from the entrance to Tikal archeological sites so it is a convenient place to base.  They offer food and can arrange transfers as needed.  Staff is polite.  Hot water and electricity do not run the entire day so plan ahead."
30,"The Tikal Inn was a great place to stay--very comfortable, clean, and no bugs in our beautiful, pool-side cabana! Of course, there are the limitations of staying in a national park in Guatemala, like limited electricity and hot water. The main downside was the guide we contracted through them (Andres) was not a great guide, and the archaeological tour and sunrise tour had repetitive information (we had been assured by the front desk that the information on each was different and that we should do both). The meal package was also not worth it, but ordering individually from the menu was good."
40,"When planning our trip to Tikal we had originally made reservations at another hotel in the park. We ended up adding an extra night to our trip, and since the original hotel that we booked had no rooms available on that night, we made a one night reservation here instead. We weren't disappointed.  As other reviews have mentioned, adjust your expectations accordingly. There is no electricity in Tikal National Park, so all of the hotels in the park run on generators. Power is only on for a few hours in the morning and a few hours in the evening. We knew this before making reservations inside the park, but from reading other reviews, it seems like not everyone is aware of this. So keep that in mind! When we checked in we were told when the electricity would be on so we could be"
40,This is a modest hotel with a great location.  It would have been 3 stars due to the limited provision of electricity and internet (it’s not the hotel’s fault however it is an issue) but the terrific staff (especially David in the restaurant who was engaging and attentive) deserves an extra star and I enjoyed the food much more than I enjoyed much higher priced meals in Antigua.
50,"Definitely if you visit Tikal you want to stay here! The little thatched-hut cabanas are comfortable and clean. Guatemala shuts power off in intervals throughout the day and the power goes out around 9 p.m. They have rechargeable lights in the rooms to assist you in the night. It was pitch black and the howler monkeys kept us up much of the night!! If you don't know what howlers sound like you'd think there was an alien invasion! But it was really cool to hear them throughout the forest during the night. Use the bug screens around your bed, there is a reason they are there. This place has a restaurant (just okay but given the remote location you can't expect anything fancy), and a nice swimming pool on the property. We walked around the nature trails early the next morning and"
40,"You are paying to be in Tikal park.  We were unaware of the limited electricity and internet.  The hotel has new management and they worked very hard to accommodate our requests.  They were very friendly and helpful, especially new manager Josh.  The room was clean and kept clean.  We arrived in the early evening and was told to order dinner first, then go to the room to unpack so we still had light.  That's when we found out electricity is on from 6:30-8:30 a.m. and 6:30 to 9:30 p.m.  We found out those were approximate times, sometimes having the electricity go out early made it more interesting.  The ceiling fan goes out too but it was cool enough to sleep comfortably, even with a light blanket at times.  We were told the wifi was ""spotty"" as it was by satellite.  It was"
40,"The Jungle Lodge is an old friend, having stayed there in 1982, 1998 and now in 2019. Its location on the doorstep of Tikal, plus the quality of the accommodations and the food in the restaurant, make this the place to stay for an extended visit to Tikal, if you can get in.  We came to Tikal both for the ruins as well as the birds that are protected here in the park. Many hard-to-see birds are easy here, but it was a complete surprise to see wood rails walking about the hotel lobby early in the morning, searching for moths or lizards or whatever they might find before the tourists wake up.  I complained to Don Julio about the lack of horizontal storage space in our room (the armoire only had a bar for hanging shirts et al.) and he said they would work on the issue. I suspect"
50,"This place is truly beautiful. We stayed in one of the exploration headquarters rooms and it was even better in person. This accommodation does not miss a beat when it comes to classy, thematic decoration and high quality materials. With that kind of room, you have a communal gendered bathroom and shower facility- it was kept immaculate and was also really high quality- hot water, nice soap, fluffy towels, pretty showers, etc. The room faced the jungle and was shady, never hot, and you could hear the sounds of nature at night which was magical. The hotel main building has a surprisingly good restaurant (pepian dish, frijoles soup, fruit smoothies were very good), friendly service, pool table, cool bar, and a movie area where they played NatGeo documentaries. The pool area was"
50,"Jungle Lodge Hotel made me feel like I was in Jurassic Park the movie without the dinosaurs. This is the nicest and lux hotel in TIkal National Park without costing an arm and a leg. There are 3 resorts in the area while this one is the closest being right outside the gate of the site.  My husband and I stayed in the standard rooms which is very modern. We had the chance to also use their best suite, which his the Jaguar suite and I would definitely book this one the next chance I get to go back to TIkal. Both rooms were very modern while the Jaguar suite is just BEYOND. There's an indoor and outdoor access shower area, your own private back-yard style patio with a Jacuzzi facing the jungle. Bathtub and shower with views! the living space is huge with really modern and urban mix"
50,"Our family’s stay at the Jungle Lodge was an incredible experience! The accommodations were excellent with clean and comfortable rooms. The jungle setting is unique and ensures you are only a short walk from the incredible sights of Tikal. The pool was extremely refreshing after a long day of hiking through Mayan ruins and the attached bar was much appreciated. Finally, the restaurant food was delicious and the staff was friendly and very accepting of our lack of Spanish speaking ability. In addition, the Jungle Lodge seamlessly coordinated our transportation to and from the Flores airport, tours of Uaxactun and Yaxha, as well as a sunrise tour of Tikal. Our trip was further enhanced by our excellent tour guide, Cesar Augusto Moran. He possesses an encyclopedic knowledge of the"
50,"Our bungalow (#1) was surprisingly modern, with updated decor and furnishings.  There was a king bed with mosquito netting, pull-out couch, leather club chairs, free-standing bath tub, rain showers (one indoor and one out), a hot tub and patio furniture.  The food was OK, and the food service was a bit slow but very nice.  The bar area was also newly decorated and included a game room.  The front staff arranged for us to get a guide of Tikal for $80 USD.  Sam was wonderful and showed us all of the highlights in about 3 1/2 hours."
30,"Located at the park's gate, Jungle Lodge is very useful for early tours. Rooms in the hostel side are very basic with shared toilets outside. Very friendly staff, good restaurant and affordable tours offer."
50,"I spent two nights here in April and could not have asked for a better place to stay. Unlike the other lodges in the park The jungle lodge keeps the fans on even when the power was turned off. Trust me you want this! Especially at night since it is extremely hot and sticky in the jungle. We did the sunrise tour organized through the hotel and it was great. Worth it to get out there early, I can't imagine being in the park in the heat in the middle of the day. We were done by 1000 and spent the rest of the day relaxing by the pool. We stayed in a standard room which was a little bungalow, nice and clean with very comfortable beds (I'm picky with beds). If you are flying into Flores and planning on doing the sunrise tour make sure you get your park passes for it at the airport"
40,"As the name suggests, this lodge sits in the middle of the rain forest, and also within walking distance from the world-famous Tikal Maya site. Our room was a quite luxury separate bungalow. The infrastructure was OK, and we had a very fine dinner and breakfast. But service was extremely slow on all points of view, as well for dinner, breakfast as for check-out.  During our visit to the Tikal site we had showers of pouring rain, but that could not temper our enthusiasm. At the end of our visit we were showed out by spider monkeys."
50,"Walking distance to the Tikal ruins. The staff is very kind and the rooms in excellent conditions. They arranged our tour to the ruins, Tony was a very cool guy. I would just recommend them to be more clear in the information about the sunrise tour, we missed it because of misunderstanding about the purchasing of tickets, other than that all excellent."
40,"The hotel is great, right in the middle of the jungle. Multiple times at the pool saw Spider Monkeys and got up to a tucán like a meter away. The hotel is what you need, clean and nice. The front desk attention was pretty bad, we arrived in a van from the airport, multiple parties(their shuttle) they know we are coming. We spent over an hour at the lobby waiting for checking in.... one guy VERY slowly checking everyone in... but then restaurant was good food for the circumstances. BUT they offer service at the pool, and it’s crazy slow. Multiple times I had to go inside to order the food. The pool service is very bad and slow, the regular restaurant wasn’t slow.   They cut at electricity at 10:30 I believe was the time, and one socket is on all night. For us wasn’t a problem,"
40,"Jungle lodge was realy a lovely place to stay. Great rooms lovely jacuzzi in the garden, a outside shower, and all was great. The breakfest offered scrambled egg, and a lot of other things. The dinner choises was great too, but our european people need some who could talk a better english. There were a lot of misunderstandings. But they were kindly anyway."
50,"We love to visit ruins and have been to several around the world. When we decided to go to Guatemala I knew we needed to take the flight and visit Tikal. I didn’t want to deal with the long drive into the park for the sunrise tour so we decided to stay in the park and get the full experience of the jungle. The jungle lodge lived up to their photos. Our room was great, we stayed in a room with a king size bed. The lobby, restaurant, and bar were lovely and the food really good. We loved the coffee and Guatemalan breakfast.  I saw several reviews mentioning the tour guide Tony so I requested him as our guide for 2 days. I’m so glad we did! Tony’s father was the local Guatemalan who organized the logistics for the University of Pennsylvania who uncovered much of Tikal in the 1950s."
50,"Generally wonderful experience here with a great tour of Tikal led by Caesar. It was an intimate tour with only myself and two others who joined at the entrance to the park in contrast to the larger groups of tourists I saw roaming the park. This I was able to arrange at the hotel easily on the night of my arrival at a fee of $25 usd in addition to the standard park entrance of 150 quetzales (it’ll be more if you do the sunrise or sunset). I stayed on the “hostel” side and it was lovely. As far as I can tell the only thing that made it hostel-esque was the luxurious shared bathrooms outside of the rooms. My room was nicely appointed with a full-size bed, ceiling fan, and mosquito net. The windows were screened as well so they could be left open for comfort. I slept very well and"
50,"Amazing place to stay! The people are helpful, the facilities are well kept, and the pool is a nice bonus after a day of touring Tikal. The restaurant is a bit pricey but you can expect that being in a remote location. You’ll hear the monkeys throughout your stay and if you’re lucky, even see some! This is a must do! "
50,"What a wonderful time. Except for the lack of AC and intermittent electricity, the room was fabulous. The room was modern, clean and beautiful. The fans kept things worked well and keep things comfortable. I tend to like it cool when I sleep and usually use the AC freely at night, but without it, I still slept like a baby. I slept so deeply that I missed howler monkey cacophony in the early morning. The rooms are in duplex buildings on paths throughout the property, with the jungle surrounding you. We only a minute walk to the lodge and pool. The pool was exquisite and we spent lots of time there. The lodge is beautiful and has a nice restaurant, bar, pool tables and they showed a Mayan documentary in the conference room the night we were there. The staff were wonderful.  My"
30,"We actually really enjoyed our stay here even though there is no electricity all night and not really any hot water even when there is supposed to be (but we found this all over Guatemala!)  The room is cute. Not well kept up, but fine for a one night stay. My son loved the hammock out front of our room and loved wandering around the grounds looking at the coati and tucans.  Food is super expensive here for not amazing quality. Think $10 butter pasta with chicken pieces.  The staff are SUPER helpful and friendly which make up for any downfalls the hotel has.   We stay in a range of places and this was totally fine for what we wanted - to stay inside the park so we could spend as much time at the park as possible.  Took a morning sunrise tour. Their English speaking guide was off"
50,"Set your expectations correctly, and you will enjoy this hotel and its surroundings. It is at the heart of Tikal National Park, a very short distance from the main pavilion and the entrance to the trails leading to the ruins. Do not expect luxury, though it is quite clean and nice. Instead, expect wildlife right out your backdoor, the sounds of the jungle at night, excellent fresh meals of local flavor and attentive staff in the restaurant, and a relaxing experience. The grounds are well kept, and the pool is inviting. As mentioned by others, the electricity is shut off at night (I think throughout the park,) so it was somewhat warm at night without a fan. Being that you are already in the park, which occupies a very large expanse of land, when the sun rises, you have the"
40,"Der Campingplatz besteht aus einer großen Wiese am Dschungelrand, auf der eine Hand voll Bungalows steht. Man kann dort Hängematten mit Mückenschutz (mit Löchern) oder Zelte ausleihen (nicht inklusive). Wir haben in den Hängematten, die in einem Bungalow gespannt wurden, ""geschlafen"". Nachts hörte man nämlich die Tiere im Dschungel und vor Allem die Affen brüllen. Die Möglichkeit zu Kochen gab es an einem kleinen Feuer, welches wir selbst - mit Hilfe des sehr freundlichen Angestellten - machen mussten. So auch Sitzgelegenheitenheiten. Wir hatten zum Glück einen Topf, Besteck, warme Kleidung, Stirnlampen, genug zu Essen und zu Trinken dabei, was wir auch jedem empfehlen würden mitzunehmen. Denn es gibt dort zwar einen kleinen Laden für das nötigste (Cola, Bier,...) und ein"

20,"We stayed here as it was very close to the national park, and that’s all it has going for it really.   The tent we got showed to was on concrete very closely surrounded by other tents, rather crammed in and only had one single mattress for the two of us. We then had a look around to see if all the tents were like this and they weren’t, so we managed to swap tents to one on the grass, once we found some staff.  Then came darkness... the single lightbulb above the shower attracted every insect in the nearby rainforest to make it a very unpleasant experience, from avoiding the frog on the floor to insects avoiding the flying bugs at head height, overall it was  dreadful.  During the light hours there is also little to do here other than the park.  It was very overpriced for what"
50,"I chose to hammock camp here rather than the public camping area. Their facilities are new and very clean, it's very close to the park entrance and I enjoyed eating at their restaurant. My family does not enjoy hammock camping as muchI do so when we come back we will rent rooms. Lovey courtyard with beautiful flowers, hummingbirds and the odd monkey or other jungle visitor dropping in to visit."
40,"It's inside Tikal National Park.  Clean, spacious rooms and surroundings.  Not that much varied food, but it's enough for a short stay.  There's a period when there's no electricity, but, I guess, that's part of the ""jungle experience."""
30,"Good value and great location. Not as nice as the Jungle Lodge but less expensive. Power is off from 9:15PM to 6:30AM. Meals are basic and fine, beer is cold, service is friendly. Difficult to get connected here. Troubles checking in because of connectivity."
50,"Lovely relaxed hotel in the jungle. One of our sons got sick in the evening  and the hotel manager Roxie drove us 90 mins to a hospital and translated for us. We were then able to come back to the hotel the next night and enjoy the sunrise tour the next day. At the hotel we saw numerous birds (Toucans), coatis, agoutis, crocodiles and a garden snake. Great Experience"
40,"My husband, my friend and I stayed here for one night. When we arrived we were served a welcome drink and given an explanation of the hotel, you only have power at certain times and they kept the kitchen open to serve us dinner. The service was excellent and the food was very good! The rooms are simple, but comfortable with mosquito netting. We slept well through the night. The pool is in great condition and the grounds are beautiful. I highly recommend staying here when visiting Tikal."
50,"We loved this place.  Not fancy, simple and super comfortable with beautiful grounds oh, and an awesome pool.  You are literally sleeping in a part of Tikal.  it's amazing.  The staff was SO accommodating, and really helpful.   Great fresh meals in the restaurant.  I will be going back as soon as I can!"
30,"We got to Tikal with a shuttle booked at our hostel in Flores (Q80/p). We left at 12 from Flores (we would have left later but it was the last shuttle), planning to spend the night at the camping site and visit Tikal the day after. At the bank before the park entrance we bought a normal entrance ticket (Q150) and a camping ticket (Q50). The entrance ticket can be used for the next day (or later - tickets are valid for 30 days), so there is no problem with having to buy two tickets like we had read somewhere before.  On the camping ground we asked for hammocks (with mosquito net), had to negotiate to get down the price from Q50 to Q35 per person (earlier we had read of prices at Q30). The man was nice though and installed them for us in a location close to the jungle. As there is"
50,"We stayed here for 2 nights/3 days and we would highly recommend staying for at least a night or ideally more. The facilities (toilets and showers) were very basic and only accessible by asking the care taker who was a very friendly man always around somewhere. There are also a few stalls there with basic snack type things/filtered water and a little comedor type food place too. We saw and heard all sorts of animals in the campground, one of the main reasons we wanted to visit here is to see and hear these animals, we saw howler monkeys, spider monkeys, coatis, some big spiders at night and some other mammals and birds which I have no idea of the name of. It's worth noting it is almost guaranteed you will be woken up at around 4 30-5 by the monkeys making their loud calls, for"
50,"We stayed at the campground for one night, planning a sunrise tour on the next day. No need to make any reservations, the place is pretty big. You can sleep in hammocks or in a tent, just bring plenty of warm clothes and ask for blankets because we were freezing at night (we didn't realize it would get THAT cold). Don Diego, the 'Manager', will be ready to help you, as will the guys selling merchandise and food just next to the campground. The restaurants were too expensive for us and they provided us with hot instant noodles soup and a can of beer, cookies and chips! At night the jungle doesn't sleep, you'll hear very loud howler monkeys all around you, and it is mind blowing. "
10,"If you are into campsites where they shut off the water, you can't be outside your tent, and are forced to go to sleep as soon as you are done with dinner, this is the place for you.  I knew it would be basic. But I also expected a few things. The water was unpredictably shut off, so you didn't know when you would be able to use it. I didn't expect to take a hot shower at all, but there wasn't even enough to use and rinse off soap (with one person at a time using the shower). And I couldn't even brush my teeth because nothing was coming out of the sink. Wonderful site.  I also expected to be able to sit outside and look at the gorgeous sky. They have no seating area, so once you get back you your site, the only place to go is inside your tent that is under a covering.   I would"
40,The location is the big plus of this lodge as it is literally at the entrance of the main walking trail leading to the Tikal site. You feel really lucky to be at the swimming pool after a long day of hiking while others have to jump back into their bus for 2 hours of driving. Amenities are basic but clean and spread around a lush garden. I even saw a monkey while I was in my shower! Electricity runs only for a few hours so it must get hot in summer.
50,"A wonderful experience to be able to stay right in Tik’al Park at Jungle Lodge Tik’al. Stylish yet not garish, a jungle experience with modern day amenities. The hotel arranged a sunrise tour with expert English language guide, Tony, a character unto himself but who had an incredible depth of knowledge of all things Mayan and Tik’al. Definitely worth the visit!"
30,Its in the park...so thats convenient . Rooms are large. Theres a big gap between the bed and the wall so your pillows disappear all the time. Bathroom is ok .There is no wifi in the room and it didnt work in the restaurant  either. Food and drinks in the restaurant is exhorbitant and of only average quality . Staff are friendly.
50,"This place is great to stay one or two nights if you want to be close to Tikal. They are great if you want to do the sunrise tour (which I highly recommend).   The food is great, the staff is super friendly (they helped me sew my backpack back together!) and the rooms are comfortable and clean.  It's a place for the outdoor and nature lovers."
40,The fdn bus was delayed by 7 hours and we rang the hotel en route from Santa elena. They offered a brilliant package for us to stay and allowed us to pre-order meals and even went to get museum passes at the front gate for us when we hadn't got them up front. Staff are friendly and I Can't thank them enough for making the stay memorable.
40,"When we booked our stay Jaguar Inn I was prepared for VERY basic accommodation.   As it turns out, I found the stay to be quite nice. The rooms are fairly basic but ok. The beds are really comfortable and the shower water was hot.   We didn’t have air conditioning (I’m not sure it’s available) so we had to leave the windows open. The baby in the room next door cried a lot and kept me up late. The turkeys who live in the park were also making noise at some point and the howler monkeys were calling at around 3:30 am.   The wifi is supposedly only on for select hours but it seemed to me to be on all the time. It’s not fast, so don’t expect to do much aside from check messages.   They also say the electricity is only on during select times. I didn’t notice a shut down at any time."
40,"We loved the Jaguar Inn.. I only took one star off because there was a dangerous grate that my daughter fell through (there was a small hole and she just happened to step on it just wrong) and got a big gash.   Also, the food is expensive.  The bungalows themselves were clean, considering the location (there were occasional bugs on the floors, especially in the bathroom) directly in the massive jungle, and the hot water and fans worked great.  They warned us about the hot water and electricity times but I guess we got lucky and had hot water even a little after 9 and fans stayed on most of the night.  I was  SO scared it would be ridiculously hot because it was supposed to be high 90's in the days - we got there around 6:30PM and it was warm but not unbearable and was pleasant"
50,"This hotel was the residences for the archeologists.  So you are right there in the park. The few dollars you save by staying further away at the lake, are not worth the time it takes to get to the park. Here you can walk into the park so you can go in the morning, walk out of the park, have some lunch at one of the fondas [ our favorite was Imperial Maya] ,come back to the hotel, have a swim and go back to the park.  You need at least 3 days in the park to explore and if you are right there , you can do it in a relaxed state. Take 1 tour with a guide and then go back and explore on your own.  The hotel staff was friendly and helpful.  We had a great room with mosquito nets that felt like something out of a movie and a shared outside bathroom. But the bathroom was big and clean"
50,"We stayed two nights in this wonderful place, in the hostel. It was spotless, including the communal bathroom. It had private stalls with a shower and toilet. The staff, every one of them, were efficient, pleasant, engaging. The food was good and it was all reasonably priced. They hooked us up for the Sunrise Tour of Tikal National Park which was simply amazing. Highly, highly recommend."
50,"I've stayed here many times and can't get enough. Victor, the manager, is so kind and does an amazing job of making you feel welcome, even though he is so busy. Kevin at the front desk is so kind. Can't say enough good things about the staff!"
10,"People were smoking all over the lodge. Couldn't be near the pool because of smokers. Apparently, there is a smoking zone but it's not enforced. The hotel was half empty yet they put someone right next to us and we could hear their every noise.  Another reviewer mentioned the loud kids running around. We experienced this, as well. The hotel response was they have no control over rude guests. This isn't true. It's the manangements job to inform rude guests and their out of control children, that they are disturbing the other guest."
20,"The national park is breath taking but our stay at the lodge left quite a bit to be desired.  I understand it is off season, but the service was unacceptable for the price we paid.  Also, one mentioned that hours that the power is off, that's right, the power was off from 8:00 am to 1:00 pm and from 3:00 pm to 5:00 pm and best of all, 11:00 am to 6:00 am.  That was not mentioned on hotels.com or expedia.  This is the jungle, if you don't like sleeping in a puddle of your own sweat, stay in Petén.  It is only a hour buss ride. Also, I understand it is the Jungle but our two nights we had a Scorpion in our shower, at tarantula in our bathroom and a big grey spider under the net over our bed (pictures below).  I was told the the Scorpion and Tarantula bites aren't lethal, I would"
40,"Really enjoyed listening to the wildlife. We were treated to an evening of lightening bugs  (fire flies) floating around in the dark.The cottages were very comfortable, but they are close together and it was easy to hear the conversations from the neighbouring cottages. The pool looked pretty green when we arrived, but was blue when we left."
50,I spent two days and this place was awesome! The staff was nice and food was great. There is only electricity during certain times and hot water plus no tv and this is in the park. I totally recommend this place.
50,Was very nervous about staying in the park.  Do not like bugs and was worried about cleanliness.  This place was perfect!  Unbelievable clean!!  We were able to enjoy hiking in the morning and relaxing by the pool in the afternoon and back into the park at night.  The pool is an added bonus and pool side service from Eddie was just perfect.  He was very attentive to our needs.  The breakfast was delicious also.
40,"Good hotel, its located inside Tikal national park. There are no TVs, AC or WIFI in the rooms. But after walking the park you will go straight to bed. Wifi is only available at the main lobby area. Staff members are very friendly. "
50,I have stayed here three years in a row during my June trips and will be returning in June 2019 for my fourth visit.  The staff here has been nothing but fantastic to me and my student groups.  They take great care of us.  I have stayed in just about every type of room here.  Walking around and getting to see and hear the jungle is amazing. I have tried everything on their food menu and it all is very good in my opinion. Julie Roahrig
20,"The heat and humidity (along with no wind) made it a sticky experience.  The howler monkeys make a lot of noise at 4:30 AM.  Sunrise is at 5:30 AM.  The toilets are basic.  The showers looked gross, so I did not use one.  The toilet paper is not in the stall, but is on the wall inside the building.  They are two person tents with one mat and sheet.  So, there is room for your bags.  Most tents are in groups of three on an open cement platform under a roof to protect from rain.  There are no lights on the grounds, so one needs a flashlight to walk from the bathroom back to the tents."
50,"Tikal is an amazing site, I loved it!  We went there for the sunrise and I think is the best moment of the day. When the tourist advisors say that you can experience the mature waking up a only word can come in your mind ""bull***t"" but it is exactly like this because not just the colours become brighter but slowly you can see animals come out their dens and you can listen to the noises of twittering birds and screaming monkeys and others. Our guide, Carlos showed us all the beautiful pyramids and temples describing the history bringing up interesting parts like the Maya numerical system. We walked since 4.30 waiting for sunrise that we watched from temple IV and we carried out walking through the jungle and Carlos showed us the living part Tikal talking about the liking animals"
50,"We decided to stay in Tikal campground, because is the cheapes option were to stay in the National park and goes along with great night jungle experience. You have to pay 50 quetzales at the main gate to the park for get the permit to camp in this site. Then you can hire a tent or hamock. We hired a hamock for another 50 quetzales and it was a great choice. I was little bit afraid because of the insects and other ""jungle staff"", but the hamock has a mosquito net and everything was ok. You can enjoy the jungle sound for all night, and every hour the sound is different - monkey, birds, frogs... and you can just imagine what exactly is. There is no electricity in the campground. If you don't need a fancy place, this is really good option how to enjoy this fabulous place :-)."
50,"Tikal – Guatemala Tikal is both a fascinating and an unbelievable place. Let me start saying that you should consider taking a tour guide, once you get there. Most of these persons know a lot about the history of the Maya civilization, the best paths to go to the various key places, as well as of the surrounding nature; they are also knowledgeable of life in Guatemala, if you are curious enough to learn about past and modern life in this country in Central America. There were 7 of us, and we went there with a rental car, from Flores. Tourists pay 5 times more than locals to enter Tikal, which may be a bit annoying. Also, make sure you get there as early as you can, to enjoy the full potential that the place has to offer.  Further, be prepared to walk a few miles, sometimes"
50,Es una zona arqueológica muy grande ! Más grande que palenque así que lleva ropa cómoda y algo de tomar. Hay baños al interior del parque . Ve con tiempo yo diría q el parque se ve en 1 día o mas pero las principales atracciones las puedes ver en una mañana . Lo único malo es el sistema de los boletos. Me parece caro 
20,"The bungalows and the garden are nice. The hotel is close to the entrance of Tikal and perfect to stay 2 or 3 nights en fully enjoy Tikal. The restaurant has vegetarian dishes, but you have to ask for it.  There is one big problem with this place which made our stay unpleasant: they have about 15 smalle tents on the property, which are used by backpackers. Some of those tents were just 3 meters away from our bungalow. And backpackers are sometimes in groups and very noisy. We experienced backpackers sitting in front of their tent with a radio on max volume!!! In a peaceful environment like Tikal!!!! So the small tents full of backpackers had a very negative impact on our stay. Our advice for the hotel management: or be a hostel or be a lodge. But you can not be both!"
30,"This basic accomodation (no air con, no pool) is overpriced because of its premium location near Tikal National Park. My plan was to see a sunrise, over the jungle treetops from the top of a mayan temple. So, the location of the Inn saved an hour's drive from the nearest town.I had to purchase a special entry ticket and pay for a guide for the experience of walking 40 minutes to arrive long before the first rays from the sun pierced the pre dawn dark. I was so grateful that the morning was not misty. My photos are amazing. I can highly recommend the Chicken Mole (Chocolate Chicken) main course at the restaurant."
50,We stayed at the hotel jaguar inn for two nights to be able to do the sunset tour and be at the park with the least amount of tourists. The hotel staff were very organized and sent an email ahead of time about purchasing tickets to the park at the Belize/Guatemala border to avoid waiting in line to purchase tickets at the one Banreal bank booth at the park entrance. They also arranged transportation from the inn back to Belize to catch the ferry. The hotel is basic And if you’re looking for something fancy this is not the place for you. The restaurant is a fun place to be in the evening as it seems a lot of people gather there and the food was good. It’s great to visit Tikal and be able to stay in the park and staying at the jaguar inn made it possible! 
40,"Jaguar Inn sports simple rooms in a complex set around a nice green area. The rooms are everything you need for a night or two, but there are no bells and whistles. My shower was nice and hot, but apparently that's not always the case. The restaurant serves a broad variety of dishes that are a bit more expensive than I'd want them to be, but you can't beat the convenience. Jaguar Inn is only about five minutes away from the park gates.  The highlight for me was the staff at the reception - they were simply fantastic. Due to unforeseen circumstances, I arrived into the park (which is where the hotel is situated) after closing time and without a ticket to the sunrise tour the following morning. They were able to organize not only my late arrival, but also my ticket for the sunrise"
50,"As part of a tour group, we camped on the grounds of the Jaguar Inn.  I cannot comment on any of the rooms.  The tents they set up for us included mattresses, pillows and blankets and were quite comfortable.  There were clean toilets and cold-water showers available.  There is no power after about 9pm, so charge your devices and bring a flashlight.  There is a restaurant on site, as well as some limited WiFi.  The primary virtue of the Jaguar Inn is that you are very close (less than 100m) to the entrance of the Tikal archeological site, which means that even with a regular entrance ticket, which allows you to enter at 6am, you might be able to catch the sunrise, or at least have the ruins mostly to yourself for an hour or so before the big tour groups arrive."
40,"This was a little scary, as I'm not the best camper around, however it was a fun experience for one night. We stayed here as part of an Intrepid tour (Land of Belize). we arrived in the early afternoon, put our bags in out already set up tents (yay, didnt have to work that out) and headed in the National Park to explore the Tikal ruins. We got back before sunset, which is good because there is no power. Some people had showers, however I opted to forgo the cold shower at night. We had dinner at the Jaguar Inn, where there is electricity until 9pm at night (so you can charge your phone/camera battery if needed). All in all it was a once in a lifetime experience and recommend to anyone!"
50,"Es una experiencia muy agradable. Se puede llegar en carro o colectivo, se paga desde el aeropuerto hasta el parque ida y vuelta U$50. En la entrada cobran a los extranjeros U$25 por persona. Te recomiendo que lleves Quetzales que es la moneda oficial de Guatemala. Al parque lleva agua y alguna fruta. No necesitas guía pues los mismos caminos te llevan a las pirámides. "
50,Véritablement majestueux. Magnifique et plein d histoire. Certainement le meilleur endroit de tout le séjour. Passage obligatoire quand on est au Guatemala. De plus il y a bcp de choses à voir er de merveilleux points de vues. Je recommande 
50,"Visitar Tikal a sido una de las experiencias mas gratificantes conocer la cultura maya y sus templos con la belleza de vista es simplemente increible, la comida dentro del parque muy rica con tortilas hechas a mano."
50,"Tikal es una de esas ciudades de la cultura maya que simplemente no encierra solo ruinas, sino majestuosidad. Cuando buscaban candidatas para las nuevas maravillas modernas del mundo, yo quería que fuera incluida. He disfrutado cada lugar que he visitado como si fuera la ultima vez, pero debo regresar para descubrir siempre algo nuevo. La energía que aquí se siente es encantadora. Quedarse aquí, pernoctar aquí es algo que no tiene explicación, solo hay que hacerlo."
50,"Our one night stay at the hotel was wonderful (would have liked to spend another night there...). We had a very comfortable family room of 4 with a jungle view, and we could see the monkeys jumping on the trees right from our room. Decoration is simple yet very elegant. The food at the restaurant is a bit pricey (but normal given that we are in the middle of the jungle) but very tasty. We also enjoyed the pool after our Tikal sunset visit as well as after the day visit. During the day you have monkeys wondering high up in the trees around the pool, and they make you remember (in case you have forgoten) that you are in the middle of a beautiful lush forest and next to an amazing ancient Maya city."
20,We received a very unfriendly welcome. The food was disappointing as it was served cold and incomplete several times.  The accommodation did not meet the  expectations set by the (high) price.   The rooms and pool were okay.
50,Very good small houses with bathroom and veranda.  It is good to relax in the pool after a hot day in the archeological site.  Very friendly and helpful employees.  Good diner and breakfast for reasonable prices
30,"My wife and I stayed at this hotel for one night in March 2019. I think that most people only stay one night in order to visit the Mayan site of Tikal. It was ideal for this purpose because it was right next to the entrance to the site. So one could access it early in the morning before other tourists arrived, go back and have a break in your room/the public rooms of the hotel during the heat of the day and perhaps go back into the site later in the afternoon. Our room was very nice although the noise from the overhead fan from the room next door did keep us awake. Electricity is only available for restricted hours each day, but that did not cause us a problem. After all, you are in the jungle! The service in the restaurant was very poor. The restaurant supervisor, an older man,"
10,"My family has been here a few times and will never return after our last. trip. 1. We took the shuttle and the front desk clerk insisted we pay upon arrival then refused to give us a receipt. When we went to check out, we were again charged for the shuttle. The receipt they gave us was one large charge with no itemization and way beyond what we spent. 2. Smokers everywhere. My grown daughters stayed in the shared bathroom units that have tiny slat windows. Other guests would sit in front of these windows and smoke, filling up their rooms. It was hot and the fans only run a couple of hours a day. My daugher ended up having a major asthma attack. Smokers surrounded the swimming pool constantly. 3. The pool is useless because of said smokers but screaming, running, kids. One kid"
50,My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Tikal Inn and enjoyed it very much.  Easy access to the Tikal park and great birding opportunities.   The pool was clean and refreshing at the end of the day!  We felt the food choices were good and the staff was friendly and helpful.
20,"Their customer service for billing is absolutely the worst. They are incredibly rude, threaten, and make accusations that are outlandish. I don't know if they have issues with people not paying or what, but Miguel in particular is extremely demeaning and rude. I tried to make a simple correction in the billing and they ignored me entirely until I explained I would have to challenge the charges. Upon this statement their response was ""I will destroy your reputation on social media"". What kind of business makes these kinds of claims when you are merely trying to correct an error. I travel the globe literally and have never seen such poor customer service. I tried to speak with them over the phone, email, and in person; all terrible. Such a shame for a beautiful hotel. Billing in"
40,"Love this hotel because of the rustic feel, the limited number of rooms, the peace and tranquility, and because the staff truly makes you feel welcome and cared for.  Our three experiences spaced about 2.5 years apart have all been excellent.  Are there slight imperfections?  yes.  But to us, it adds to the charm.  We, and the guests that we have brought here, have all loved it.  Will absolutely stay here again. I believe its great for couples, family, and friends."
50,"We really enjoyed our stay here. Before you go, you should know that it is an eco-lodge and only provides electricity and hot water at certain hours in the morning and night. There is only very slow WiFi available at the reception. And you cannot flush toilet paper down the toilets. Nevertheless, it’s a beautiful, very clean, and peaceful place to stay. Being right in Tikal is perfect!   We loved our bungalow by the pool. Our beds were super comfy with clean sheets and mosquito nets. The bathroom is simple but the shower has great water pressure and is big enough for two people. Not having “hot” water during the no-electricity hours was no problem for us. You could still get semi-warm water (and it’s hot outside anyways). It was very clean and there wasn’t a single bug inside"
30,"We stayed 1 night at their room which is on a satellite building abt 200metres from the main building. No electricity 8am-6pm, no room wifi, no tv and services could be better. Not much choice of food in the area either. In fact, food and prices are definitely better in Flores and Antigua. The natural environment was nice, we saw the toucan and parrots. Overall though, for the prices we paid, we left feeling 1 night is enough and glad to be out of the hotel. The Tikal ruins was magnificient btw."
50,"Our second visit here, prior was in 2002.  Just a nice now.  Rooms were clean.  Parking was safe.  Restaurant was good, we particularly enjoyed club sandwich.  Good bird watching from room porch.  I use a CPAP machine at night and was kindly given unit 8 which has power all night."
40,"We wanted to be onsite in Tikal to do the sunset and sunrise tours in the park.  I chose Hotel Jaguar Inn Tikal because they were the first to respond to my email inquiry.  I arranged for our room through Booking.com, and directly with the hotel for the tours and private transportation to Flores.   We arrived on a Saturday afternoon and were checked in by Mr. Carlos.  Mr. Carlos speaks excellent English and is a very pleasant and helpful.  While we waited for our room we had an excellent lunch on the terrace which is very pleasant.  We saw a number of redlored parrots and enjoyed the resident spider monkey peering down at us from the trees.  Our room was very basic, and a bit shabby, but very clean.  The mattress was firm, which we prefer, and comfortable,  I caught a glimpse of"
50,"It's a bit more on the expensive side, but the location directly inside the national park is great and allows for a sunrise tour at Tikal which started at 4am. We had a great stay! If you are coming straight from Belize, try to get money somewhere along the way, that might spare you the detour via Flores. ATM in El Remate did not accept our cards, so we had to go to Flores, get cash and then take a colectivo back up north into the park."
30,"A quite good, but not extraordinary, hotel near Tikal itself. Typical Guatemala standard, that is, average.  Very poor wi-fi.  Average and very expensive food.  beautiful surroundings.  Helpful staff with poor English"
30,"a couple of friends travelling around Central America anyone do use booking.com and Tripadvisor for their go to info. As in some cases these portals say fully booked but if you email the hotel directly they do have vacancy, which was the case with us. the replies via email were sporadic to say the least and even through i explained everything/requested etc for the sunrise tour it was a total fail. We arrived approx. 6pm where the manager on site gave us the generic attitude and wasn't at all interested in helping us, or try to help and just blamed the park (meaning TIKAL park) of the inconveniences that we were experiencing.  we wanted to do the sunrise tour, even though emails no one told us that you need to buy the enteric ticket and then an additional ticket for the sunset or"
50,"Taking a trip to this remote spot on the planet.......will really give you the sense of TIME-TRAVEL....!! The campground is well maintained and security is great. Camp under the stars, and you will hear all the wildlife talking to each other. What really is fascinating, is that the Mayan inhabitants were looking at the same stars, over 2000 years ago...WOW When you visit the largest of all the mayan cities, you really get the sense of its enormity. Hundreds of square miles made up this city, with huge pyramids and temples. Walking around in this ancient site..... you can actually feel the presence of the ancient civilization. Not to be missed.......YOU WILL LOVE IT...!!"
50,"Imposible. No visitar este maravilloso lugar lleno de cultura milenaria, rodeado de la flora y fauna de la selva tropical del Peten, uno de los pulmones del planeta tierra, la atención muy buena con precios económicos "
50,"El parque es impresionante y sus edificios son impactantes. Es un gran lugar para aprender de la historia Maya y de arqueología puesto que está muy bien conservado. El tour del amanecer es increíble, caminar de noche por entre los caminos indígenas y ver cómo se despierta la selva y su fauna perfectamente conservados es una experiencia única. No pierdas la oportunidad de hacerlo.  Es incluso mejor quedarse en Tikal que hacer el tour es Florez."
50,"It is breathtaking all the beautiful pyramids and ancient buildings in the middle of the Caribbean jungle.  Very genuine experience with lots of culture and history.  The Park is very well kept.  There is a canopy zip line attraction as you arrive at the park. Bring lots of drinking water and wear hot weather clothing, you will need it.  Also to enjoy to the max you need mosquito repellent and sun protection. Comfortable shoes are a must.  It is just surreal to walk in the middle of this beautiful ancient city.  You can climb up some pyramids and look upon the horizon of the jungle. An amazing experience you will never forget.  You can lodge in the city of Flores, which is about 40 minutes drive to Tikal.  The City of Flores is an island in the middle of lake Flores.  Hotels are"
50,"Immerso nel verde della foresta pluviale,  mostra i suoi monumenti man mano che si cammina. I templi sono eccezionali, abbastanza ben conservati e, se scalati, oltre ad un panorama meraviglioso, facilitano la comprensione dello svolgimento della vita in quei luoghi.  Fantastico."
40,"I care to Tikal to spend 4 days on the March Equinox and stayed at Inn. It was really close to the gate so I could go and wander around for a couple hours in the morning, come and have breakfast, swim, relax on the grounds, and then go back to the site. It’s such a quiet and peaceful place with amazing birds, monkeys, wild turkeys and Central American raccoons surrounding you. The staff were great and helpful. Warning that the internet access isn’t great - you are in the jungle - and the power is off in the rooms during the day. Again, jungle vibes:)  The food was OK, as a vegan my options were limited, but the fresh fruit and fried plantains were awesome!"
30,"Fantastic location right in the middle of Tikal National Park. Because of that the electricity isn't good and is only available early morning and evening. Mosquito nets are provided and I actually slept really well.  The rooms are on the small side. The restaurant is good, we had dinner twice there and can't complain. Breakfasts are excellent. They sell some nice wooden bits and pieces at the reception. I am really pleased with the salad servers I bought."
50,"We loved our 1 night stay at Tikal Inn. We booked the cheapest rooms which were away from the main part, quiet and surrounded by jungle and wildlife. Saw spider monkeys within 2 mins of arriving and a huge hawk when we left. Rooms are basic by Western standards but clean and bed was comfortable. Lots of hot water.  Very friendly staff and great breakfast. The pool was an added bonus and great for cooling off in. You could also see lots of birds in the gardens around the pool Wish we had booked for 2 nights instead of just 1. Highly recommended"
40,"We booked the cheapest rooms which are located at the Rancheon, about 200 meters from the main building along a well lit trail. The main building is somewhat outdated, but provides for everything. Everything is clean and spacious.  The staff is super service minded and kind.   The hotel is located about 200m from the park entrance."
40,"Tikal Inn is the last of 3 other lodges, therefore the most isolated. The rooms ( most are cabins) are very comfortable without being lavish, good restaurant with a very friendly staff. Next to the Inn is a beautiful meadow surrounded by wooded areas. Often you can encounter lots of coatimundi also known as mapaches or deer. I find this magical."
30,"The best about this hotel is that it is situated right at the entrance of the Tikal site, 5 min walk from the first temple.  The hotel is beautifully decorated, nice restaurant, lobby and rooms.  However a big issue is that the rooms have no airco and temperature is around 30 degrees Celsius at night!"
50,"The property was prefect for the time we were in the park. We stayed for 2 nights.   The best part of our experience was the interaction we had with our guide Tony Ortiz. We were with him for the sunrise tour and a private tour for the evening. He is knowledgeable, positive, and entertaining. We had a blast with him. I suggest doing a group tour in the AM and a private tour in the evening. Use the middle part of the day to rest. Ask for Tony in advance he is a popular guide and his time books up. We lucked out by getting him.   Be aware that buying the tickets to the park is a cumbersome process and it takes some preplanning. Make sure you contact the Jungle Lodge in advance. You will have to provide them a pic of your passport. Don’t be alarmed by this. It is a part of the"
50,"My husband and I stayed here for one night in the ‘hostel’ (If you can call it that!) section. The room is beautiful and we saw quite a few monkeys and birds right from the balcony. Share bathrooms are really nice. We did both the sunset and sunrise tour. Both of our guides were excellent. They were super informative and spoke perfect English. You do see much of the same stuff on both tours but each guide has unique stories and we did see some new places the second day on the sunrise tour.  If you can only choose one, I’d recommend the sunrise. Walking through the jungle in darkness to get to Temple IV was really cool and then once you’re there listening to the jungle progressively wake up from East to West was pretty magical.  There were no bugs when we were there and although"
40,"To explore Guatemala on your own is an adventure. Things don't always work out the way you planned and you must be prepared for a couple of unpleasant surprises. This hotel has its downs: wifi is available only in common areas, lights go out at 11 pm... but, to be in the middle of the gorgeous Mayan jungle, it's worth it. Be sure to carry something for mosquito bites and plenty of sun lotion. "
50,This was one of the highlights of our trip!  The location was so incredible.  There was something truly magical about hearing the wildlife and seeing it all so close.  Tikal is phenomenal - we did the sunset and sunrise tours which were amazing.  The lodge itself is really lovely and the staff were delightful!
50,"We spent 3 lovely nights at the Jaguar Inn. Before we went I messaged the hotel with a couple of questions about tour logistics, tickets, airport pickup, money, and Sofia explained everything and helped me plan ahead. We got to Flores airport and the hotel shuttle was waiting for us. The driver took us to the “bank” where we bought Tikal tickets and after he helped us exchange money at the airport cafeteria (the bank wouldn’t take a $100 cause it had a tiny tiny cut). We got to the hotel, after quite a drive, checked in and went straight to bed tucked in under the mosquito net. The room was beautiful, modern bathroom, no glass on the windows, just a double net that did keep most things out. Tikal is moist, humid, so the air flow is a must. Electricity is supposed to be off at"
40,"Stayed here for three nights. Located just outside Tikal, appr. 200 meters from the entrance.  Rooms are clean. Allthough in the jungle, there weren't any mosquitos, bugs or whatever in the room. Every day fresh towels and cleaning. Electricity and hot water during specific hours (morning, evening). The hotel supplies candles for the night. WiFi only in the restaurant, sufficient for messaging and small pictures. Breakfast, lunch and diner is good (standard), not exceptional. Unfortunately they ran out of mineral water, quite a surprise.  Staff is friendly and arranged a sunrise tourguide (small extra charge). Payments through Visa is not a problem."
40,"It’s my first time at an eco-hotel, I found Jaguar Inn to be very well kept for a hotel in the middle of the jungle, it’s surrounded by nature and you can expect to run into some insects and birds.  I like the fact that the room we stayed at was very well covered against insects - windows and door.  Thankful with the personnel who were always very nice and explained how the schedule for electricity and hot running water.  For breakfast I recommend the Lost World Pyramid, it’s very good! "
10,"Before getting started, I should mention that I'm a travel agent, and for this I can be a little picky. However, it is also for this that I know what I'm talking about, and for which I would never, ever recommend anyone to stay at the Jaguar Inn Tikal. Now, as there are many things that must be said about the hotel, and I don't mean to bore you guys, I'm just going to bullet-point and short-describe what was good, bad, and awful.   * Service- just like every Guatemalan, staff is indulgent, and always willing to give guests a hand, with a smile on their faces.  * Tour Guide- the hotel has its own tour guides, and the guide that showed me and my couple around was just great! He was very knowledgeable, kind and always eager to go the extra mile!  * Drinking water- guests get"
40,"When my tour agent booked me at the Hotel Jaguar Inn in Tikal, I was a bit concerned because I was only aware of the other inside the park accommodations (Jungle Lodge & Tikal Inn).   I must say I was pleasantly surprised when I arrived.  The bungalow (#5) was perfect.  The king size bed was comfortable, the bathroom was very clean and the staff were all very accommodating.  Edwin served me most often in the restaurant and he was very friendly and spoke excellent English which is a plus for me.  As is all lodging on the park, hot water is available only certain hours and the electricity is available only certain hours as well.  Although I couldn’t time my showers to have hot water, the cold shower was very refreshing after a hot day in the park.    The restaurant served basic,"
50,"Tuve la oportunidad de Visitar las ruinas mayas de Tikal, después de muchos años de haberlo deseado, Es un lugar Majestuoso y maravilloso, Todo un complejo de una antigua ciudadela de la civilización maya, Tikal fué el lugar más importante en su momento, El lugar es muy bello y muy bien conservado, tuve la oportunidad de hacer el tour del amanecer, una bella y fascinante experiencia subir al templo IV aun en la oscuridad y esperar que amanezca y ver las crestas de los templos asomando por la bruma de la mañana y en medio de la espesa selva  es de una emoción indescriptible, imagina uno y se transporta a aquellas epocas, despues de esto el guía nos narra toda la historia del lugar y sus antiguos habitantes por alrededor de mas de una hora y media donde fuimos recorriendo senderos"
50,"fuí en Agosto con mi familia, al ser temporada baja allí., estabamos solos. impresionante. interesante tener un guia que te explique cada uno de los detalles. sube a  las pirámides el expectaculo es maravilloso, la vision de la selva."
40,היה לנו אחלה מדריך בשם נתנאל אפרים. כן זה השם האמיתי שלו. היינו בטיול זריחה שהתחיל חביב אבל אחרי זה היינו בעיקר עייפים ורצינו רק ללכת חזרה למלון. מומלץ לטייל כי זה אתר היסטורי אבל לא נפלתי..:) יש שם כל מיני סוגי ציפורים ובלילה כשהגענו הצלחנו גם לשמוע את שאגות הקופים שזה היה מגניב.
50,"Tropikal ekzotik bir orman içinde antik Maya uygarlığı kalıntılarını, tapınak ve piramitleri görmek istiyorsanız adres burası. Gitmeyen önce küçük bir yer olduğunu az sayıda kalıntı bulunduğunu düşünmekteydim. Ancak yaklaşık altı saatlik sürede sadece yarısını gezme fırsatı bulduğumuz kalıntı alanının sadece %20'lik bir bölümü gün yüzüne çıkarılabilmiş..."
40,"Magnifique site Maya en pleine nature comme celui de Copan au Honduras. marche agréable et découverte du site au travers de la végétation. Attention aux lianes (Mayal) tapissées d'épines, au bord du sentier. deux restaurants sont sur place, l'un à l'entrée et l'autre dans la forêt.."
50,"We stayed at the Hotel Tikal Inn and had a marvelous stay.  The customer service was amazing, the cabana (pool side) was just perfect.  They educated us on the times for hot water and electricity along with meal options that could be added.  They are very efficient and strive give the best customer service possible.  Will definitely stay again"
40,"When I visited Tikal i encountered rainy weather which threw a monkey wrench in my plans to see the morning sunrise. So at 4 AM I am lying in bed feeling unhappy. But suddenly i realized how wonderful the rain and wildlife noises, coming through the meshed windows up near the ceiling, sounded. Yes I would have liked to see the sunrise. But the sonic experience of a rain soaked tropical jungle at night is also wonderful.   The good stuff: Tikal inn location is wonderful being right in the park. The staff is generally very helpful understands English, for non Spanish speakers like me. The topical ambiance is charming. Food was simple but good. I like the fact that unlike in the US the food portions are more reasonable over there in general.  Could be better stuff: Power is only"
50,"The staff is friendly, and extremely accommodating.  The tour guides (Andres especially), are knowledgeable, engaging, and insightful.  The rooms(ours was by the pool) are beautiful and comfortable.  We love the atmosphere of this hotel.  Julio at the front desk will take care of your requests, Hugo the driver is helpful and efficient, and Josue is one of the friendliest waiters my wife and I have come across in a long time.  They all certainly left an impression, and made our experience in the jungles of Guatemala and extremely beautiful national park a memorable experience.  Thank you all!"
40,"My partner and I spent five nights at the Tikal Inn, which is perfectly located for easy access to the park and adjacent to some rainforest walking trails. Our room was fairly basic but very clean, with a lovely view across the well tended garden which borders on to the rainforest. I have a particular interest in wildlife and staying in the rainforest and gently waking to the sounds of the dawn chorus; howler monkeys, oropendola, parrots etc, was a real highlight. In the day many other birds and butterflies can be observed in the garden, with fireflies at night.  After long walks around Tikal or following the trails it was great to be able to cool off in the Tikal Inn pool. Staff were smiley and welcoming and the food was very nice, although as others have mentioned be prepared"
40,"We stayed one night in a pool-side bungalow.  The room was clean with a cute front porch. The pool was awesome (but simple - keep in mind this is a National Park hotel not a resort).  Restaurant service was very good including poolside lunch service. We did not do the inclusive meal plan and based on other reviews, sounds like that was a good choice.  We had lunch, dinner and breakfast and found all of them to be somewhere between good and really good.  It is not cheap, but the quality and service was good.  As other's mention, electricity is limited to certain times, but we did not find this to be a problem. We were there just to see Tikal, so we were fine with early to bed.  Sounds like from other reviews that the other two hotels in the park are nicer...that may be true, but"
50,"First thing to note is that the Lodge is located in Tikal. So when you walk out of the concierge building you are at the mouth of the park where everyone starts their Tikal tours. In researching our stay with them, I was unclear on the distance but you couldn’t get any closer for your excursion to Tikal. At the end of the lodge driveway/entrance to the Tikal temple area part of the park, you begin with a mile long walk up to the concentration of temples. If you have mobility issues, you can pay 20Q per group to ride in the back of a rickety truck to save you that walk. The truck runs frequently so you can also take it on your way back. If it’s a hot day or you are not a fan of walking, it can save your energy levels for climbing the temples.   The Hotel Jungle Lodge itself is"
50,"We stayed there for 2 nights and that was a great experience. The room was very nice and comfortable, and it is very quiet, just at the entrance to the park itself, so that you can enter very early or leave at sunset. Food was nice too. The pool was not that clean however and it's a bit pricey,but we do recommend it!"
50,"We loved the Jungle Lodge and visiting Tikal in the early morning before the crowds. The hotel had many community spaces; the pool, the ""Zen Lounge"", a pool table, foosball, and games to lend. The food was good and reasonably priced and we saw so many amazing animals within the grounds (coati, ant-eater, rainbow billed tucan, and of course the haunting cry of the Howler Monkey at 4am). Stock up on water before you leave Flores to save some money - we took 4 gallons of water for 2 nights for our family of 4. Overall, wonderful. "
50,Lovely hotel in the jungle. The restaurant had good food and was a good value. Hearing the howler monkeys during the night was both eerie & fascinating! Staying & eating here was a nice break from the prices we’ve been paying while in Belize. Don’t hesitate to stay here if visiting Tikal.
50,"Let me start by saying that if you travel to the middle of the jungle in Guatemala and expect to stay at a 5 star resort, forget it! You can not find a hotel with butler-service, spa-treatments, room service, and so on. What you can find is this beautiful little jungle lodge, that exceeded our expectations by far. The hotel lies in the middle of the Tikal national park. The hotel picked us up at Flores airport, and it´s about an hour drive from the airport to the hotel. From the minute you enter the reception you get the feeling of being at a true jungle lodge. Absolutely 100% genuine! The paths leading to the rooms cut through the thick jungle, and the rooms are spacious (we had a room with two double beds), clean and refurbished. There is a nice seating area, nice furniture,"
50,"It was my first time visiting Tikal went the first week of October and I researched many hotels and decided on Hotel Jaguar Inn Tikal for the jungle experience. My mother had stayed a few years and a friend of my mother had also stayed at the hotel recently. I didn't know what to expect as you can see from many of the reviews some are good and other not so good. I decided to give it a try. I can say this research what is your best option to get to Tikal (its very far from the city), make travel arrangements with a travel company or go through EL Dorado bus line to get you to Flores and take a taxi to Tikal (options are very limited and can be costly). **Note: if you have a reservation for a hotel inside Tikal, once you pay for the entrance to Tikal and you don't use your park"
40,"Visiting Tikal, we wanted to be close to the action, so we opted to stay at one of the hotels in the park, rather than in Flores or El Remate. We organised a taxi transfer fro Flores airport through the hotel, and the driver was there on time to collect us. He advised us that we would need to take money out in town, as there is no cash machine near Tikal. En route, we stopped at a shop. If you need anything, make sure that you buy it before getting to Tikal as there are no shops there. Buy insect repellant!  Upon arrival, we checked in with no problem. We were immediately struck by how friendly the staff members were, and their bright and helpful demeanours were by far and away some of the best which we have encountered on our travels.   Although you can camp at the Jaguar Inn,"
30,"A nice hotel and a really nice and friendly guy at the reception, who provided us with a lot of information. No airco and the electricity turns off at 9. But, that's part of sleeping in the jungle - respect for nature, which is a good thing.   Keep in mind that since 5 months ago a day ticket bought after 3 pm, is the day after not valid anymore! You simply have to buy two day tickets. So, staying a night in the jungle leaves you a difficult choice:   Or you decide to go just one day (but buses leave at maximum 2.30 pm and you'll need a full day to see all of Tikal, so that means you better buy a sunrise ticket).  Or you buy two day tickets.  Or you go early, stay there the night and go home early.   Apart from that, the hotel itself was fine. Nothing really to complain about."
20,"Jaguar Inn is one of the few hotels at the enterance of Tikal. The rates of the rooms are way too high. Concerning hotels its a better option to stay for example in El Remate - that is just about 40 minutes by car/bus to Tikal. There you have very nice hotels for 1/3 of the price of Jaguar Inn.  The restaurant of Jaguar Inn doesnt fit with the roomrate. The menu has hamburgers, sandwiches and spaghetti - and 1 or 2 other dishes. That's all.  Very poor wifi.  They use ""we are in the middle of the jungle"" as kind of excuse - but I ve been in more remote places who have much better facilities/service."
40,"We really enjoyed our stay here despite having read a few questionable reviews.  Jaguar Inn is located 17km inside the Tikal National Park.  You must pay for your entry to the National Park on the way in to the park. This allows you entrance to the Park to visit the monuments.  Should you want to visit at sunrise or have a guided tour there is an extra charge.   We opted to take a sunrise tour with Ronny from our hotel. He was an excellent guide, very knowledgeable and even gave our group a bit of a wildlife tour too! We saw lots of wildlife and heard the infamous Howler Monkeys.  The hotel was very comfortable and the restaurant food was superb.  Given you are staying in a remote National Park there are restrictions on water and electricity, however, we didn’t experience any"
50,We walked up to Francesco who was in-charge of the camping ground and asked if we could stay in tents of Hammocks for the evening. We opted for the hammocks at 90Q pp and it was totally worth it. Francesco sets of the hammocks and bug nets for you and you can sleep under a hut to shelter you in case it rains! There are bathroom and shower facilities near by as well. In the morning we were woken by howler monkeys and other noises of the jungle which was an unforgettable experience. We followed by going into Tikal National Park to catch the sunrise! Highly recommended!
50,"One of the coolest experiences in this park are the howling monkeys. Unfortunately, they only come out at nightfall! So if you would like to increase your chances of hearing these lion - like howling animals, you should plan for visiting the park in the afternoon. In average takes 4 hours to see the sites, so if you start at around 12:30 you would have good chances of living this unforgettable experience...have fun!  "
50,"Es una experiencia inigualable! muy pocos lugares ofrecen lo que Tikal si lo hace.  Recomendaría que contraten a un guía, para así aprovechar al máximo todos los templos y entender un poco más la cultura Maya.   Es algo que no se puede describir, ya que deben de ir.  Es bien seguro!!!"
30,"The accommodations are very basic- a covered concrete patio to keep you dry and bathrooms, but if you want to experience the sounds of the jungle and get early entrance into the park, this is the way to go. "
50,"We opted for the sunset tour which was quite good. We left Flores via shuttle at noon and got to Tikal by 2 PM ( van made several stops). We had a tour guide Abel who was quite knowledgeable but talked too much that it was difficult to fully comprehend the history. It was very hot and humid so bring lots of water ( there are places to by water at the park entrance). We stayed for 4.5 hours which we felt was adequate. We watched the sunset from the top of one of the temples which was nice. We heard that the sunrise tour was disappointing as it is usually foggy in the morning. Our tour cost 110Q plus park entrance of 170Q pp. There are places to stay in the park too. We saw spider monkies, howler monkies, parrots, red falcon etc. It was worth going out of our way to experience"
10,"We booked this hotel for a family trip, the pictures in the website are not accurate, when we got there the place smelled bad, furniture looked filthy, the staff wasn’t friendly, the restaurant gave us the impression the food will make us sick. No working fans in the rooms, barely electricity, no WiFi service to communicate, the pool was dirty, the place looks rundown. When we arrived to the lobby we thought we arrived to their storage room, no presentation. We decided not to stay there after seeing all of this, when we asked for a refund or part of it the complete refused to do it. Their customer service was terrible, they don’t care for their customer, only for the money. For a few more bucks it’s better to stayed at The Jungle Lodge. We will never use Tikal Inn again and will"
10,"3 hours of electricity a day!!! Staff was wonderful. Hotel was not. Food was ok. Room was horrible. Not enough electricity to even take a shower. Could not sleep at night with no fan, ventilation, and suffering heat and humidity.   Pool was nice. One of few bright spots. We asked for superior room. They said all booked. Lol. All were empty.   The place should be condemned or used as an off-the-grid campground. "
10,"Well I read tons of bad reviews and decided that,maybe, it was bad luck. However, Luck, wasn't the case. We got the Dinner included package and when we ordered they didn't bring the side dishes that it said at the bottom. I asked the waiter and apparently the two items that we ordered did not come with side dishes which was total Bs. Anyway   There's no electricity but from 6pm-10pm Rooms are Hot Service is horrible, (you would assume that after tons of bad reviews and complains they would improve)   Anyway don't be cheap like us and pay the extra bucks to stay nextdoor lol"
10,"We stayed there for two nights. We booked breakfast and dinner for two days. On the second day, he said we didn't pay for it. We spent €200 for two nights and two meals, please keep in mind that Guatamala is by European standards a very affordable country. We asked for our meal on the second day and he asked us for €32, we didn't want to pay that, the food was adequate but not worth anywhere near that. We walked for 2 minutes and outside the hotel was a food stand. He wanted €5 for two people. It was much nicer than the food in the hotel and he was much more friendly."
30,I picked the cheapest room. El Ranchon which is farther in the jungle. I liked the location but it was very basic. Put on bug spray while you sleep. I got lots of bites. Had some issues with pickup from their shuttle and was an hour late arriving. I originally picked the breakfast dinner package but i didn’t think it was worth it. Limited choices and only advantage seemed to be dessert. Nachos were good. Pool was a little cloudy but nice.
30,"We only had one night, great rooms but they did not cope with late dinner service even though we were told meals would be available for another hour. This was a shame as they let the rest of the hotel down.  Clean comfortable rooms."
50,We stayed for 2 nights in the Jungle Lodge Tikal (excellent stay!) and we especially enjoyed the sunrise tour under guidance of Tony.  Tony knows EVERYTHING about Tikal and it was fantastic walking in the early hours of the day with him. We definitely recommend taking the tour with Tony!
50,"At the entrance to Tikal National Park, the perfect place to stay.  The Lodge and grounds are immaculately clean and tidy.  Animals, plants and birds are everywhere.  The staff is friendly and helpful.  The restaurant serves excellent food and drinks.  The pool is large and clean, the sundeck is inviting.  Everything about this place is excellent.  The only complaint I have, has nothing to do with the lodge itself, but rather the confusion over where and how to buy tickets to Tikal.  The hotel does not sell them directly, and if you want to go on a sunrise tour, you have to buy your tickets the day before, an hour and a half away at a bank in Flores.  It is the weirdest and most inconvenient system I have ever encountered.  I'll go so far as to use the word stupid on the part of"
40,"Jungle Lodge Hotel is a very nice facility obviously recently renovated. We stayed in a standard room which had a king sized bed. The nice thing about this hotel, in addition to having a pool to cool off in during the heat of the afternoon, is that it has power to its ceiling fans and an emergency light all night long. Everything in the park runs on generators so this is a rarity right now. You can save almost $20US per night if you book directly through the hotel web site. We were not so pleased with the restaurant on site but that's another review."
50,"Amazing jungle resort. Amazing hikes (Jungle hike with Elvis was a highlight) & excursions to spend the day. Hotel itself is an incredible self-sufficient lodge perched over a river in a mountain canyon. Absolutely beautiful and unique location - a fantastic place to stay whether you’re there as a couple, family, or with friends. 5 Stars! "
30,"The best thing about this place is it's location, as it's a very short walk to the entrance to Tikal. Plus the owner (or manager) is also a good man and very helpful.   The accommodation (we had a bungalow) is average. It was cleanish, though wasn't cleaned or more relevantly toilet paper bin emptied during our stay. It really could have done with a mosquito net around the bed. Cheap and easy to organise, me thinks.  The worst thing was the food. We don't eat much meat and ordered two of the very few veg options on the menu. The Italian salad was appalling and surprisingly the nachos barely edible (we loved and lived on nachos elsewhere in Guatemala).   We had thought this was standard fare for the Tikal hotels until we went to the hotel next door, and instantly regretted not"
50,"My stay at the Jaguar was a brief but enjoyable one.  A member of the staff who went by the name of Edwin helped us whenever we needed anything.  His directions and tips were bang on and he was  very accommodating.  I found the room to be quite comfortable and the even the showers were quite good considering we were in the middle of the jungle.  One warning is that being in the jungle, the power is shut off from 9pm to 9am.  However, it was really soothing, being completely surrounded by the sounds of the jungle while falling asleep.  If you can live without electricity for twelve hours then I definitely recommend Jaguar Inn for your stay at Tikal.  You will also see some nice wildflowers and possibly even a wild turkey or two like I did.  It's also worth mentioning that it was"
40,Great spot in park. Within walking distance to entrance. Simple restaurant. Thankful for their back up battery which kept fans running all night.  Just be warned. You are in the jungle. Expect bugs. Lots of mosquitoes and wifi is sparse ;) enjoy the surroundings! 
30,"My friend and I stayed here for one night so we could do the sunrise tour at Tikal. The cut off the electricity from 9pm until 12noon, so don't expect a hot shower or wifi during that time because its not happening.  I give it a 3 because they can could offer better food vs the American type of food. I came to Guatemala to eat their traditional food not American. Also there were some guests making to much noise past midnight and the staff could have done a better job controlling them. Not getting good rest due to their laughing and talking loud was not helpful having to wake up at 3am for the 4am sunrise tour.  It could be a better hotel if they worked on those issues.  "
30,"My wife and I visited in June of 17 and decided to stay in Tikal so we could do the sunrise tour in the park. There weren't too many options in terms of hotels but Jaguar Inn seemed like the best place for the best price. The room and bathroom itself were clean and the temperature was fine for sleeping (even in June). The hotel had electricity and water restriction times so we weren't able to run the fan at night, but the temperate was still decent in the room. (I believe each hotel in Tikal has similar rules in terms of electricity and water.) One night cost around 40 bucks, very reasonable.   But... before arriving in Guatemala, I had contacted hotel about transportation to Tikal and they sent me info for transportation that was double what I ended up paying. I would recommend"
10,"This place is a pretty much a dump, but thats sort of what you expect when staying in the actual park, so ordinarily I would not complain. However this place took it several steps further putting it firmly on my S@#T LIST. Specifically  - lights go off at 10 PM - rude, lazy, dismissive service - abusive guests - toilets that block as soon as you use them - concrete bunker rooms - No AC - No fan when the power is switched off  ..OK you might say that the hotel cannot control the type of guest that arrives, but when a man is verbally abusing a woman in the main restaurant and the staff/manager do nothing it's pretty bad.   Good things about the hotel  - The pool is OK and needed after climbing pyramids all day...but you cannot use it after 9:30 PM"
40,"We stayed here for a night and found the accommodations to be more than adequate.  Power was available overnight and a ceiling fan made it easier to sleep than in the non powered places we stayed on our trip.  In the morning, we were woken by all sorts of furry and feathered critters running around outside.  The pool was nice to have and the food was pretty good as well."
30,"There is nothing fancy about this spot but if you are interested in being as close to Tikal as possible, this is a good choice.   The hotels within the park are all required to limit their electricity use so you are going to want to bring a spare battery charger for your phone/camera/whatever. Wifi must be on a secret backup generator because I did receive a signal even when the electricity was off. I was able to get a signal in my room, only because I was right next to the lobby. In general, wifi is only available in the lobby and not in the rooms.   Our room was clean and the staff was very friendly. We enjoyed our two meals. Some of the decor is a little 1970s but it's not like you are going to hang out all day at the hotel when you are on the doorstep of such a spectacular"
40,"My wife and I found the staff very pleasant -- especially the restaurant employees. As others have said, our room was basic but clean. It's also a very pretty setting, and you'll probably get the chance to see some wildlife -- e.g. turkeys, coatimundi, birds, etc.  This is not a fancy hotel. Nor does it present itself as such. So I don't think it's entirely fair to judge it by those standards, as some of the reviews here seem to be doing. I don't know what the other two hotels outside the park are like, but if you think it's worth it to spend a night at Tikal in order to take a sunrise tour or to have the chance to be in the park when the crowds are smaller, this is a very good option.  If you're looking for a luxurious hotel experience with spas and Godiva chocolates on your"
40,"Good basic hotel conveniently located close to Tikal National Park. Great food and excellent service by the dining room staff. We enjoyed the pool in the hot afternoons! Special thanks to the manager, Roxy Ortiz, for her help and advice."
50,"This national park is a discovery and the history is fantastic. Take a guided tour to understand the site and the Mayan culture , temples and the background if thus magnificent site. Simply astonishing!  I visited the park in December 2008 or 2009 "
40,Travelled with my daughter to Tikal. We selected this hotel to be able to explore the site after the daily crowds. It was an excellent location. We stayed in their jungle suites with a jacuzzi and the room was beautifully appointed.Food was not excellent and sometimes they ran out of ingredients and ice. I mention ice because it was really hot and the drinks were not cold long enough for me. The staff is excellent and very cordial. Please note that this hotel is amazing but did not have air conditioning which we missed dearly at temperatures of nearly 40c. Still I am rating it 4 stars because we did get all that we had signed for. I highly recommend this place if you want to be in a special setting and have Tikal to yourself just before sunrise or sunset.
50,"TLDR; Unforgettable digs for the night. Dont hesitate about bringing your geat, there is a ""secure"" place to store your stuff. And it's cheaper than anything else in the area. Inns/comedors have so-so (price and quality) food and sporadic Wifi. Stay and you wont regret it.  My wife and I slept in side-by-side hammocks for our one night in Tikal. There were NO issues with the accommodations. The hammocks were sturdy material with a bug net. If you enjoy camping (glamping even), then do this. We did not have reservations, just showed up around 10AM and had our pick of a tent or hammocks. We chose hammocks because we aren't cavemen and they are hammocks. We were able to rent everything and pay for the campsite all with the very nice warden/groundskeeper. He was friendly and eager"
50,"Посетили древний город с группой.Перед экскурсией покормили и пошли смотреть руины, вообще впечатляет, одевайте обувь удобную, ходить придется много. Видели обезьян, попугаев, лису. Строения впечатляют, раскопали процентов 10. Поднимались на пирамиду.Рекомендую к просмотру."
50,Me and my friends booked sunrise welcome trip to Tikal. Although the trip started at 3am but it worth without hesitation!  Tikal is absolute must to see in Guatemala. It´s so  magical to sit on the highest ruin and and listen to all jungle voices waking up. Then seeing all the temples was stunning!
50,"Si vas a Guatemala debes ir a este lugar, es increíble que a pesar los años podamos disfrutar de esta maravilla, tienes cientos años de historia y pensar como construyeron estas monumentales construcciones es asombroso...no te lo puedes perder..."
40,"We stayed here after our sunset tour of Tikal park. It was so convenient to stay so close to the park and not have to travel at night. We had a wonderful dinner and breakfast in the restaurant. We enjoyed a relaxing swim in the pool. The hotel and facilities are modern and clean. There is no a/c and Tikal is very humid. The ceiling fan was helpful. The shower was cool, which was fine since it was so warm out."
50,"Had a great stay here, the rooms are beautiful, the staff friendly, and location outstanding for seeing Tikal.   Special mention must go to tony ortiz our tour guide who gave us a brilliant sunrise tour. Tony is charismatic and full of knowledge. His father was an archaeologist on the site and he grew up in Tikal and has been doing tours for over 60 years. He gave great insight into Mayan history, the restoration process of Tikal, and modern day Guatemala. A real highlight of our trip."
40,"The only thing that keeps me from giving 5 stars is lack of air conditioning, which of course is due to the awesome location in the park. Nice rooms and bathroom. Lovely pool and good service. Restaurant just ok, but again must consider where you are. Loved all the wildlife, and really recommend the sunset tour as it is cooler and hardly any people there. It felt special to have that kind of access to the park."
40,"I really enjoyed staying here.  It was close to the ruins and after taking the sunrise tour, I could go back at my own leisure.  The grounds are beautiful, staff friendly, room accommodating and bathrooms were modern and clean.  I would go back. "
30,"Pro's: -The rooms are very clean -You're only 1 minute from the entrance. -The rooms were reasonably bug proof. -There is a nice garden -If the router is on, the wifi works (although verrrry slow). -The restaurant staff of friendly -The furniture in the room is great (by which I mean the bed and the desk, that's all the furniture in the room)  Cons -The room is more an upgraded 2star hotel.: -There is no space for your clothes. Not even a spare chair to hang your sweaty clothes after a day of Tikal. -There is only water pressure from 6:00-9:00am and 6:00-9:00pm. And somewhere around 12:00pm. This means you can't wash your hands after toilet / before eating. -The curtains are way to small for the windows, everyone can see you lying in your bed since most rooms are directly in the"
40,"We stayed at the Jaguar Inn Tikal for 1 night in June 2017. We read all the bad reviews and complaints before hand so weren't expecting much and were prepared for the worst. We were pleasantly surprised. We arrived around 830pm and they were expecting us. We were met by very friendly (and attractive hehe) staff. We set up a sunrise tour for the next morning at this time for 80 Quitzals each (The tour and guide, Ronnie was amazing! Doing this tour is the main reason we chose to stay here. Highly recommend!!) We were surprised to find out that out room had battery backup and power. We were told that only a couple of the units had this and that it was new. It did not cost extra but we were warned that power all night was not guaranteed as they were still testing out the system. We"
40,"Jaguar Inn is best described as a jungle lodge rather than a hotel as such. Most of the accommodations were small bungalows (tent sites also available) with the property adjacent to Tikal National Park, which made it very convenient to access the Mayan ruins therein. In particular, it made it easier to do the sunrise tours & access the park in the early morning & evenings, when wildlife appeared to be most active. I enjoyed the charms of Jaguar Inn, although some guests may not appreciate some of the small animal life (tiny geckos & small beetles) that find their way into the bungalows. Some local wildlife (hummingbirds, agoutis, ocellated turkeys etc) regularly visited the Inn's garden area, & howler monkeys could clearly be heard from my cabin.  Previous reviews have mentioned"
30,"We stayed in the tents for one night and had an okay time. The tents are super-close to the hotel restaurant, under a cement overhang. Nothing fancy and not private. Luckily we had the tents to ourselves, but if there had been other camping guests, it would have been terrible, as the tents are all so close they touch one another. After the restaurant closes, employees walk by loudly with flashlights, which was annoying. We had to get up at 4am for a sunrise tour and tried going to bed early. The staff was pretty nice though, and accommodated us well, filling our water bottles and even bringing us ice. One very disappointing aspect of our stay was that the hotel told us about their Tikal sunrise tour with a guide, which I told them to sign us up for, but then didn't have their"
50,"We stayed next door at the Jungle Lodge and came by here to see if we could exchange some money.  Employee Carlos was so honest and helpful and felt like the only person in Guatemala that didn't try to rip us off and gave us a fair rate, unlike our hotel.  He went on to help us with transportation questions we had for leaving Tikal as well. The next morning we ran into him again and he helped us find the collectivo we needed for Belize, and even seemed to speak to the driver to keep him from trying to overcharge us and made sure we got off at the right stop to get another bus to the border.  All this and we were never a customer of his, he was just being nice and helpful for no personal gain. I cant review the hotel itself but can only speak for the staff which was amazing!"
30,"Ok, first of all this area is stunning but apart from that if I had the extra money it would be worth staying at one of the other hotels.   The hotel is situated right inside the parks lush jungle so you get the sounds and sites of tropical birds and monkeys (which sometimes wake you up). The pool area was just stunning, especially with sounds of birds. The rooms are  below average for the price I have stayed in much nicer and more comfortable rooms at this price in central america, BUT you are paying for the proximity to the park, beautiful settings in tropical nature and the pool. The room was super plain, just beds, bedside lamp and thing to put suitcase on. the sheets where super clean. For me the room was far far to hot, the ceiling fan didnt work well and made a super loud"
50,"Hotel Mayan Inn is in the National Park! It runs on generators and so all lighting is off by 10pm. loved it! You are cooled by the fact that you are surrounded by lush plants and landscape. You only hear what appeared to be howler monkeys (or Jaguars). We did the 4 am sunrise tour and were gently awakened by Santos. The tour guides out of hotel, Cesar and Keven were great and well informed. After that we went back to hotel for breakfast which was substantial and the service was excellent. We went on another tour after that and came back to swim in a beautiful pool in the middle of the bungalows we were staying at. After a late lunch our driver, Jeremias came to take us to the Flores airport. We wished we'd stay longer and will next time."
30,"As others have said - no electricity during certain hours, no Wi-Fi. The room was just plain; rusty bathroom, cracked tiles...no air conditioning and no fans due to the lack of electricity.  but we were up at 4 am for the sunrise hike through the park so proximity was essential.  The waiters in the dining room reminded me of iron curtain countries where you get what you get and no extra smiles for it.  Difficult to make yourself understood, but with 2 nights there it was the park we were interested in."
40," Not 6 star luxury. If you are expecting that you shouldn't even be in Guatemala. Expect around the standard of a 3 star European tourist hotel, but in the middle of the jungle and you should be fine. Our room a Junior Suite (room with 2 double and 2 single beds) was fine. Large bathroom. Hot water shower. All clean and comfortable beds. All the rooms that I saw were no more than 2-3 mins walk from reception. Points to note.. the electricity is only on in the morning and then from 6 to 9pm. There is NO phone signal for ANYONE, but they did let me use the satellite phone in reception to resolve a problem with my transport. Internet is very poor and only available in reception.  We found all the staff friendly and accommodating. We had evening meal and breakfast and all 4 of us"
30,"We have spent one night at Tikal Inn.  The room was very nice and clean.  There is a pool with plenty of long chairs.  There is no electricity in the room at the exception of few hours in the morning and at night.  This is not enough to heat water, be prepared to take a cold shower.  Meals are decent and Hotel is not too busy.  Forget also the internet connection and paying with credit card was not possible. Service is polite but serious (few smiles)"
50,"This is a smart choice when going to Tikal. It is a long drive in so staying in Tikal gives you more time to enjoy all corners.  At the Jungle Lodge there is an excellent restaurant along with a foosball table, pool table and swimming pool. Families and couples can both enjoy this lodge. It is also just across the street from the market to do your souvenir shopping and a few more restaurants if you want other options. Oh, and monkeys, monkeys are swinging from the trees above, toucans are flying over head. Great experience!"
50,"The Jungle Lodge Hotel is a unique experience for those like me a city girl not used to Eco-Friendly places. However, I must say I enjoyed tremendously my staying in this beautiful relaxing place as it is in fact the only way I can really disconnect from the daily stress of work, emails, clients, etc. All of these Lodges offer plenty of beautiful room designs, confortable beds and modern luxury bathrooms. There is not TV in the rooms or anywhere else in the Hotel, electricity is restricted as it is provided by Generators so when you check-in you will get an itinerary of the daily power saving-usage throughout the day so you know when to charge your electronic devices. (see my pics).  Staff is efficient, courteous, they speak English, place is very clean, and night time is"
50,"We stayed at the lodge to visit the magnificient Tikal ruins. Very comfortable room, beautiful surroundings. The manager Juan was extremely courteous and hospitable. You are very close to the ruins, the lodge has a decent restaurant. Highly recommend staying here."
50,Always enjoyed staying at the Jungle Lodge.Such a magical place and the upgrades in the facilities over the past few years are fantastic. Staff was courteous and extremely helpful. The food was excellent and the swimming pool/viewing deck was great.
50,"We stayed 2 nights at the Jungle Lodge Hotel.  The entire lobby, restaurant and rooms were updated and very well done.  The lobby and restaurant was open to the outdoors which provided breezes and great views of plants and animals. They also had a game room and bar area as well as showed a Nat Geo video at night on the Mayan ruins.   The rooms were very well kept and clean.  We saw Howler monkeys, spider monkeys, toucans and other birds just sitting at the pool area and wandering the grounds.  Very peaceful and beautiful.  Wish we could have stayed another day."
40,"We camped in Tikal National Park as part of a group tour. The tents were clean and waterproof which came in handy for the nightly downpour! The restaurant nearby was overpriced for very average food and the wifi was average at best, however despite saying the wifi went until 9pm, we were able to get coverage in the tents all night. A good option considering the expensive yet basic accommodation. "
40,"En época de lluvia NO compren en tour para ver el amanecer! Nosotros caímos en ese ""cuento"" y ni vimos el amanecer ni escuchamos el famoso ""despertar de la selva""... apenas si se escuchaban algunos pájaros y sólo un mono cuando un guía lo asustaba para que chillara...deprimente! Pagamos más para nada. El Parque es MUY grande y se necesitan varias horas para recorrerlo, les aconsejo ir a primeras horas de la mañana (abre a las 6am) donde van a poder ver algunos animales (monos araña, coatíes, aves de todo tipo)."
50,"La entrada a extranjeros cuesta Q150 y nacionales Q25. Es recomendable pagar en quetzales.   Llevar agua, ropa ligera y zapatos cómodos asi como bloqueador solar.   Recomendable contratar un guia para comprender mejor el mundo Maya. Los precios en guías varían en un promedio de 500-600 quetzales. "
30,"Unas ruinas muy bonitas y una visita obligada pero... cuidado con los tours y con los guias! Nosotros fuimos a ver el amanecer y pagamos un plus para poder entrar antes de que abrieran. Yo no sé si es legal o no pero para empezar nos pidieron el dinero de la entrada en el mismo bus y no nos dieron los tíquets con el valor que habíamos pagado. El ""desayuno"" fué en la entrada y eran galletas y café que llevaba el mismo ""guía"" y que por supesto había que pagar a parte. La explicación por parte del ""guía"" fué bastante pobre, seguramente no era ni guía... Así q cuidado con las agencias que contratan no vayan a ser timados también. Busquen un buen guía (que se puede encontrar allí mismo y barato) y disfruten del lugar que sin duda es precioso!"
50,"This is really worth the trip. Fascinating history and incredible views. I'd recommend getting a guide. The area is large and it would be very easy to miss some important sites without even knowing it. If you are driving over from Belize make sure you get all your paperwork from your rental car company in advance. They will want an original -with a seal. So faxed copies won't work. Your rental car company may forget this important step. So make sure to ask before you drive off. (Not all rental companies will let you take a car across the border so ask before you book). Crystal, a local Belizian company allows this. Also make sure your paperwork from the rental company matches your passport exactly or you may not get across the border. Note: It will take about an hour to get"
30,"A very basic hotel. The rooms are simply furnished but clean. In the beds you can lie well. The current is switched off at 9:00 PM. In the room are some candles available. Internet is only available in the restaurant area. The breakfast and dinner is ok. From here, the Mayan city of Tikal, Petén can be reached by foot."
30,"A very different experience, no TV, mini bar, and power goes off about 10pm, there is internet in the restaurant/reception only. The bed was very firm, bedding was clean, no flushing of paper down the toilets. We stayed for 1 night so we could visit the Ruins which was just awesome. The evening & breakfast meal at the restaurant was ok. Relaxing outside our room in a hammock was nice, seeing Spider monkeys in the trees above & watching the Hummingbirds just amazing. Make sure when you visit to have plenty of mosquito repellent, you will need it."
40,"The room (Bungalow) was perfect, it has a hammock also but no TV (Which I didnt care to have). the electricity goes of at around 8pm till 7am the next day.  The next day i made a reservation, I called them to say i was going to check in at 2am and they said it was ok. i get to the hotel at exactly 1am and there was no one waiting on me. I had to go to the hotel next door and ask if they knew where the staff from the other hotel was, a guy from the other hotel helped me find someone from Jaguar in... Long story short, i checked in at 2am really tired after my 12 hour trip to the hotel. but everything else was perfect, the hotel has parking and in next to the National park of Tikal.  IMPORTANT If you are staying in these hotels inside of the Park of Tikal, FIRST have to PURCHASE A"
50,"This was such an amazing experience!!!  One thing you should know is that the Hotel Jaguar Inn, as well as the other 2 park hotels, is located right in the park.  You will need to pay entrance to the park to get thru the main gates. The charge is 150Quetzal per person, they do not take US, so make sure you have plenty of Quetzal, the closest ATM, is a 40 minute drive away.  If you arrive after 3 the entrance ticket will be for the following day, so you can enjoy the park till close at 6p and watch the sunset and enjoy a full day the next.   I did not know this and due to a delayed flight, I had missed my original early morning flight to Tikal and arrived at 8pm instead, I called to advise them that I would be arriving around 10p, which I later found out that is a must if you are"
30,"This hotel is good if you want to stay a night close to Tikal, so you can be the first visitor in the morning. The layout is nice, small bungalows with two rooms. My big negative think is that there are is no glass in the windows so you fell like sleeping on the jungle flor. You can hear every animal outside. It my sound romantic but believe me, it is not. I was unable to sleep, and when the monkeys wake up, even a dead person can hear then scream! So definitely not a place to relax, but a place where you can listen to jungle music."
40,"I spent one night in a 'Ranchon' room.  I wasn't expecting anything fancy from a hotel in the middle of the jungle, but I was satisfied with the experience.  The proximity to the archaeological site is the real draw.  The room was very rustic.  There were a lot of small insects that I assume swoop inside whenever the door is opened, but nothing bit me and the room, bed and bathroom were otherwise clean.  As others have noted, the power shuts down early.  There was no wifi in the room in any event.  I ate two a la carte meals in the restaurant and I thought the food was serviceable.  I swam in the pool, which was welcome on a hot day.   I'd also arranged through the hotel for transfers to/from Flores and tours of the ruins.  I appreciated that the shuttles and tours all ran as"
30,"Hotel Tikal Inn couldn't be closer to the National Park and the room we had was very comfortable. The grounds were beautiful and we saw wild boar, coatis, spider monkeys and scores of varieties of birds; the swimming pool was good as well. However, nowhere in the booking were we told that power would be off from 08.00 to 18.00; the wifi was only available in the reception area and as it was satellite wifi, it was somewhat slow. The service in the restaurant was rather slow and it was not always clear what was on offer - one day we were entitled to the fixed menu breakfast and evening meal, on the other, we weren't. All a bit chaotic really. And by the way, whichever hotel you stay in, DON'T FORGET THE INSECT REPELLENT!"
40,"The Tikal Inn is right at the gates to the national park, so it enables you to enter early before others arrive -- and the ruins are truly magnifico. The inn itself is pleasant enough and rooms are clean, though it needs to upgrade to solar power. It's crazy that it's still on a generator, which means power only from 6 pm - 9:30 pm (and generally only cold water showers). Internet service is spotty but at least it exists. The restaurant manages to do pretty well despite its remote location. If Melvin is your waiter, you are in good hands! The rooms around the pool can be a little noisy if kids are playing in it, otherwise they are quiet and very convenient to the main building."
30,"We spent one day/evening at Tikal and at the Tikal Inn.  It is not as basic as I had feared so that was a good thing.  The huts have doors, windows or screens, and the beds in the room were fairly comfortable and not too soft.  The bathroom was serviceable if a little tight.  The bathroom fittings had outlived their natural lives but worked OK.    I had read that there were mosquito nets in the room but this is not true as all the apertures are covered (per above).  One problem is that the huts are cheek to jowl so that you can hear every word said by the people in the adjoining rooms.    There is a lovely swimming pool which is a great touch (not heated).  The restaurant was not bad all things considered.    Certainly the great asset is the proximity to the ruins.  You"
40,"We were pleasantly surprised with the accommodations at the Tikal Inn.  After researching this trip we were not expecting to find hot showers, beds with freshly laundered sheets and a well screened room.  All for a very reasonable price considering where we were.  I am not sure what the poor reviews are about.  Unreasonable expectations?   The food was adequate and we were able to have an ice cold beverage after a long hike around ruins.  The staff was most helpful and tried to meet any request.  The pasta dish (oddly enough) was the perfect dinner after such strenuous hiking.  Our tour guide - Jhonatan - was so energetic and eager to share everything about the Tikal ruins.  We were amazed at the site itself and the beautiful jungle.  Views from Temple IV were just awe"
40,"About Tikal: go there, it's amazing.  If you're on a budget,and want to sleep there, you have two options: - rent a tent at the Jaguar Inn. 15 us dollars per person a night. Including air matrass, sheets & blankets and using it's facilities (e.g hot showers and wifi access). - Go to the camp ground and set up your own tent, rent a tent, or rent a hammock.  Camping is 50q each, and rent of the tent is also 50q. So one night with two people cost us a 150q. The toilet building does not have light, so bring your flashlight. The tent includes a very dirty thin matrass (feels like sleeping on the floor), no pillows or blankets etc. But it's cheap.  We were the only ones who were camping there the day before yesterday. We arrived at 11am and some guy putt our stuff away in a closed"
50,"Less than 2 hours from San Ignacio, Belize - beautiful and impressive Mayan ruins and the Guatemalan jungle can be viewed after paying the Belize exit fee.  I highly suggest hiring a guide as they are extensively knowledgable in Mayan history as well as jungle plant uses!  Our guide ate termites (and offered us to try), found us fresh pepper leaves to rub on for insect repellent,  etc...The ruins cover quite a large area and still feature carved faces and inscriptions.  Definitely a must see in Central America! "
30,"Would like to ad more information to the reviews about the sunrise and sunset.T make your trip more pleasant into this city of the mayas,would like to mention that the two activities sunrise and sunset you need to have a guide as well pay an extra entrance fee of Q.100.oo per person. the natinal park just charge for the camping fees then the guards of the camping have the extra service of tents, they have manage to get some tents to rent to the visitors.Most of the coments are acurate other wise. this are camping grounds in tikal."
50,"I was so surprised that Tikal happened to be a favorite moment for me in this year of traveling. Please look at my review of Tikal park for my commentary on the tricks learned for buying tickets good for one afternoon and following day, shuttle scams, etc.  Here is just camping:  Camping fee: 50Q pp, with or without your own gear. Renting gear: There is nowhere to rent a tent in Flores. One tour agency (Mirador, dont use) offered us one for 150Q a night and tried to convince us that is the park price. Wrong! We arrived at the site at 4pm and the two hammocks and nets were already reserved, but they had a 2p tent with mattress for 75Q. They seem to have 3-4 of these available. They do not have sleeping bags or pillows. The site:  Each person gets a little bungalow with concrete"
40,"By far the most reasonable option next to the ruins.  The set up was a little confusing.  You have to pay one guy for the hammock and another guy for the site, they each chase you down to give you receipts...but at 85Q, around ten bucks, I found the hammock comfy and safe from bug bites.  I paid a guy a buck to lock up my backpack in a shed while I did a late afternoon visit to the site.  I was back up at 350am for a spectacular sunrise.  I found when I returned that someone had lightly gone through my belongings (nobody around to lock it back up in the shed at 4am) under the canvas of the hammock but I left nothing of value so everything was still there when I got back.  The bathrooms were surprisingly clean and the grounds well manicured but there were NO toilet seats (seems"
30,"Good room ,Comfortable bed  , I slept so well there but foods are not good ... expensive price not include breakfast , expensive tax but that have to pay not their fault ,wifi does't work because use satellite wifi. no phone signal in that area but not their fault also. staffs are polite .. all for me are ok except the price and foods."
30,"The best part of Jaguar Inn is the location -- you are literally across the street from the entrance to Tikal.  I did the camping option -- they provided a mattress, sheets, and a tent under a roof at a very fair price (100 qtz or $13).  It is not far from the restaurant and showers - everything is convenient.  The restaurant is pretty good and there are guys selling water and snacks next door during the day.  Its nothing particularly special...but I would stay here again if visiting Tikal just for the convenience."
30,"I'm not one of those that expects Las Vegas in the middle of a jungle, but this could still have been a bit better I think. The food was the highlight - the restaurant serves good food! Forget WiFi - it's just too flaky, even in the reception area. Just accept that you're away from the real world. This is not a complaint - we all need to disconnect more often. The room itself needs to have a bit of care and attention and then I think it will be ok. The main man at the reception just didn't seem to give a crap, but everyone else was really helpful. It's survivable, yes, but lower your expectations for the room itself. Electricity is on/off, but you know that, so it shouldn't be a problem if you work around the schedule."
30,"I found mixed reviews online and thats exactly what describes the hotel: good location, friendly staff; but sincerly overpriced, very average food (the lunch package is a real joke), and rooms are smelly and nothing special considering the price. I would definately recommend An overnight stay in Tikal, awseome place!"
40,Location was great and staff was very friendly. Price tag was a bit steep for only guaranteeing electricity and hot water from 6-9am and 6-9pm.. aside from that our stay was pleasant enough even without A/C or a TV in the room. Restaurant had great food!
10,"Location is great but that was it. Staff was surly and unhelpful. The pool was filthy, and son's foot was cut badly by loose tile on bottom. The pool filled with blood and staff could not be bothered to come from behind the bar. They did not even close the pool or help us one bit. That night, disinterested staff let drunk guests scream and yell in the lobby game room until the wee hours. You could hear them in Costa Rica probably. When I complained at the front desk, I found out that some of the people were children of the staff -- kids at 2 a.m. playing foosball and partying with drunk guests. Front staff told me I should let them finish their game because they were having fun. In the morning, staff pressured us to let other guests ride with us -- in our prearranged car -- to"
10,"So so tired of this huge hypocricy can't help but noticing while traveling in Guatemala... every single supposed ""eco-lodge"" is happy to force the purchase of drinking water in millions and millions of plastic bottles thrown out each day on their property-- EVEN INSIDE THE PARK OF TIKAL!!  Really I was suprised and horrified to find this total greedy move and lack of responsibility even inside Guatemala's largest ""ecological"" park. COME ON... it is 2019.  Get an eco-filter.  You can charge for refills.  We had no choice but to contribute to the pacific garbage patch while trying to see Tikal. Really sad."
50,This is a really lovely hotel. Bedrooms are just lovely and right within the park itself. Really loved it; I had issues with my bank cards and Kevin was so helpful and accommodating in helping me out -which I eventually managed to get sorted but it was all quite stressful and time consuming.
50,"We could have visited Tikal as a day trip from Belize, but I'm so glad we chose to spend 2 nights here and enjoy the hotel and the park at a relaxed pace.  Jungle Lodge's website was under construction when we booked so I didn't really know what to expect when we got there, but our room - a jungle suite - was lovely, very spacious with its own garden and outdoor jacuzzi (which we didn't get to use unfortunately).  The restaurant too, was very good - food was excellent, service was friendly the first night; missing in action a bit on the 2nd.  We didn't have a problem with the power going off at night - the celing fan and a socket for charging still worked.  The hotel arranged a great birdwatching and ruins day for us.  We met Benedicto from the Peten Birding Club at 06:00 for a"
40,"My husband and I stayed in one of the rooms with 2 twin beds in the ""hostal"" part of the hotel with shared bathrooms.  The room and bathrooms were incredibly clean and modern.  The windows have screens on them and no glass, so we were woken up several times in the middle of the night by people talking right outside our door.  The ceiling fan was really nice, as the temps are pretty hot even during the night!  But, the electric goes out in the middle of the night for several hours.  The location couldn't be better, set back just from the main entrance to Tikal in the jungle!  Breakfast was really good with free coffee and juice, but we found our dinners to just be so-so.  The pool was such a nice treat to jump into after exploring Tikal all day!  Monkeys hang out in the trees"
10,"We stayed one night in Tikal Inn, as we wanted to be inside the park to take the sunrise tour which starts at 4 (and didn't want to have to wake up at 2 to travel from Flores). In hindsight we should have done this, or stayed in the Jungle Lodge Hotel (which we visited and looked like it was in much better upkeep/condition).  We asked on purpose for a room in the El Ranchon and chose this part of the hotel (that was the furthest away from the Reception, down a sawdust path where it was impossible to drag a wheelie suitcase), as we had read it's the best experience of the jungle noises and life, but there was no reason for us to have chosen this, as during the night it's all quiet and only when the sun rises you start hearing the animals (I guess), but we had already left the"
50,I've been visiting Tikal since 1993 and have stayed in each of the facilities as well as camped in the open grass area. Every time I visit Tikal (at least 12 times and last in 2016) something has changed. The electricity (generator) being off at night is one that has not...get use to a little jungle comfort! None of those changes has altered the ambience of the ruins and the amazing site of an ancient city. The only thing that has changed is the size of the crowds that have caused the closure of climbing up the actual stones to the top of the pyramids...they now have constructed stairs. I proposed to my wife in 2003 on top of the Mundo Perdido and in 2016 it was blocked off to access.  Recently I had to change our reservations at the Tikal Inn where we have stayed several times
10,"It takes a lot for me to rate somewhere as absolutely dreadful - I always try to find something interesting to say about a place.  Unfortunately not the Tikal Inn.  We spent the day exploring the Tikal ruins before checking in ... and was looking forward to a hot shower to wash off the grime and sunscreen.  No can do - they don't turn the electricity on until 6.30pm so no hot water 🙄.  Ok - plan B - have a swim and a gin and tonic - can't even see the bottom of the pool it is so dirty.  Gin and tonic was great ... but they charged A$10 each!    On to dinner - THE worst food ever.  I ordered a chicken burrito which came out cold.  An English woman, who said she was 'customer service' asked whether she could taste it which I allowed her to do.  She said that was how the locals"
30,"Hotel is located about 5-7 minutes walk from main entrance. Another advantage is clean, quite big swimming pool. Unfortunately because of weather I was enjoying it only 1 hour during my 4 days stay there. Disadvantages are prices for everything. Private transfer from airport is 60 USD. They were also late 10 minutes than agreed time. You can meet monkeys, tapirs and other animals in hotel area. Besides my room was a pond where crocodiles live. I saw one crossing a path. It should be some sign warning. This is jungle so apparantely we can expect it. I didn't buy any food in hotel. There are 2 cheaper restaurants 10 min walk from hotel. I have also booked all tours in main information centre very close to entrance to Tikal. Good speaking English guides are there. Do not forget a"
40,"It seems I have a very different experience from the others who have just posted here. Yes, there are kinks at this hotel, but nothing that the staff did not correct right away. I stayed here for 3 nights and had a pleasant stay. The staff were courteous, friendly and knowledgeable. I would recommend staying within the National Park if only to avoid the mass tourists. If you really want to take in what the Park offers, avoiding crowds and entering/leaving at will are minimum, I think. It looks like the choice re limited lodging options inside the Park is a function of price. Understand fully well that you will be in the middle of a jungle, and so services really are constrained (very slow wi-fi, limited electricity, damp towels and sheets, pricier food, etc.). All staff members"
30,"We stayed here to enter the park really early and it is OK for one night. There are 4 tents right next to each other in the middle of some buildings (their main business is hotel), but the toilets and showers are fine. It is more expensive than the real campingside in Tikal, but more/better facilities too. We didn't have dinner here, but did go to another place, which was OK and cheap (go outside of the jaguar inn, straight ahead and turn a right before the entrance of the park, there is a comedor).  Great option if you want to be the first and only one in the park, which is really cool!"
10,"I booked my room through their website and took 1.5hr ride from Flores to Tikal.  When I try and check in they say ""oh sorry sir you book at our other location in Santa Elana, we do not have room for you here you have to go back 1.5hr to Santa Elena."" WHAT?? No where on there web site does it say anything about another property.  Everything says Jaguar Inn Tikal.  Their place in Santa Elena was a complete dive.  I will say our place was clean. But was not near anyplace to eat or drink, no one speaks any English, there was no hot water, no maps of town.  None of the pictures on their web site show this hotel.  Be careful with these guys they will take your money and give you the shaft."
10,"Our family group of 14 made reservations with this hotel months in advance in order to ensure that our group got the rooms we wanted and stayed comfortably close to each other.  Family members included young children and members that didn't speak the language and wanted to stay near family.  After various emails and phone calls we thought we had everything in order.  Due to unforeseen traffic and construction along the roads our bus arrived late to the hotel, approximately 10pm.  To our surprise the only person on the property at that time was the security guard.  The young guard was reading some scribbled notes that someone had left for him and had no idea what rooms belong to whom.  Months of planning and communicating with the hotel were all in vain.  4 members of our group"
30,"Hotel Jaguar Inn provided adequate accommodations, though a little shabby. We expected more for the price. Major problem was difficulty with hot water, only during certain periods of the day and difficult to adjust shower temperature. Convenient to Tikal ruins and park. Problems could be corrected to provide a very nice place. Restaurant good. WiFi service spotty. Next time we would try another of the hotels nearby."
20,"If you're coming to Tikal, the best option really is to stay in Flores or Santa Elena and take a tour up to the monuments and park from there. Really. REALLY. Apart from the sunrise and sunset tours, which are very, very, very over rated (there's no guarantee the weather will let you see either and they're not at all spectacular) you'd not be missing anything from not staying in the park. In fact, you'd be gaining a lot.  The Jaguar Inn is the best option in the park and that's not saying very much at all. It's really a glorified hostel, but charges 4* rates and claims 4* status. I've no idea how or why. That it's the best option available is probably how they get away with it. The biggest problems are power and water. There isn't any. They run a generator that powers the"
40,So you go to Tikal to see the sunrise and I found it weird they didn’t offer a early morning breakfast for the people getting up at 5am to watch the sunrise. That would have been nice. The rooms are good and the shared bathrooms are clean. You can hear the jungle noises all night 
40,"We had been told by our agent that there had been some negative comments regarding the food here (and you have no choice but to eat in the hotel as it's right in the Parque Nacional of Tikal) and I have to admit, the menu didn't look too inspiring - not helped by the fact that the menu cards looked as if they had been in use for at least five years - however this didn't worry us too much as Montezuma had, a few days before, taken his revenge on both me and my wife, so neither of us felt especially hungry. We asked if it might be possible to have something simple like an omelette and they were only too happy to oblige. Public areas are a little soulless but our room was spacious and well equipped, the staff were helpful and friendly - arranging for the power to be switched on"
40,"We enjoyed our stay at the Jungle Lodge Hotel, the service was capable, the accommodations were clean and neat and the food was tasty. We will be back for a longer visit next time. You don’t need to set an alarm clock because The howler monkeys woke us up!! Awesome!"
50,"We booked one night in Tikal, after we arrived and spent a few hours in the lodge we decided to stay one more night to enjoy the jungle feeling and the calm down. After the visit of the ruins we just hang out on the pool and had some cocktails, played pool or table soccer. The rooms were reall comfortable and clean. We had a double room with shared bathrooms. The bathroom was super clean.  The only negativ was the high prices in the restaurant and the small size of the portions.  But we really enjoyed our stay in the Lodge and we recommend  staying here as the prices are not too high."
50,"We stayed at the Jungle Lodge for five nights and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. It is only a few feet from the entrance to the archeological site and a far better option than staying in distant Flores.       Our room was in the hostal wing and was without a private bathroom. Initially, we were not too happy with the arrangement. But the smallish room was very clean and comfortable. And the communal bathrooms were spotless and we almost never had to share.       The restaurant’s food had a largely Italian menu. It was very tasty, though we would have appreciated more Guatemalan options.        The pool was a very refreshing place to relax after a day of walking in the park and we were usually entertained by the acrobatic spider monkeys.         We took two tours with Tony. He grew"
40,Tikal es además de un parque una zona arqueológica muy bonita y bella en Guatemala  Es muy recomendable visitar este lugar aunque la verdad esta algo caro y no aceptan dólares Por lo que sería recomendable que acepten dólares a que la mayoría de los turistas son extranjeros
40,"Okay so Tikal is amazing but rediculously expencive and not the most outdoor place to camp because it's by all the main buildings and a generator going until about 10pm however I believe taking the sunrise tour from anywhere other than sleeping there you will get to temple 4 late, so the cheapest way to camp is at the camp ground across from the Jaguare Inn through a big field lit with fireflys in the night, great little cabanas to keep you dry and if you wake at 3:30 your tour will be the only people to actually be on temple 4 for the amazing jungle awakening, sunrise in rainy season is misty and bland but the wildlife is worth it.... So camping is okay, two day max in my opinion, 50Q per person and if you don't have a tent 85Q per person for a misquito net hammock totally"
50,They have done this right  Set up on elevated platform with a Roof over all the tents. Close to bath/showers. And dinning.  Walk to park entrance Bath house is very clean and is kept that way by the staff. 
50,Here was amazing and good for adventurists.Views are natural and this is the best place to be if you are planning a trip to study the Mayan history.There were many crowds with a lot of school groups who came here for studying the mayan history and I was glad to see this place in my life time.I Would highly recommend here to those passing through Tikal because it is a most see wonder on earth.Though Tikal was hot but is is pretty easy to find swimming pools everywhere.
50,"Visite tikal el parque nacional en Guatemala y es el lugar más bello, lo recomiendo para visitar hay buenos hoteles cerca y más sitios arqueológicos no esperen el próximo viaje a Guatemala y visiten tikal, yaxha, Antigua, el lago de atitlan"
10,"How people can rate this dreadful hotel more than 2 stars amazes me. It is awful, dirty and will rip you off if it possibly can - it certainly tries often enough. Charging for the same thing twice, quoting prices in USD then charging in local currency at a shocking exchange rate (far worse that the rate offered when crossing the border from Belize), selling a bundled meal package that is off a restricted menu and is more expensive than buying exactly the same items off the main menu. The room was below basic, a long walk from reception even although the hotel was far from full, electricity went off at 9 pm and there is no light for the long walk through the grounds at 3 am for the sunrise tour of Tikal (which we booked through the hotel). All in all one of the worst hotel"
20,"The only hotel at the entrance of the Archaeological site, was undergoing some refurbishment in Dec 17. Room 33 has two double beds, a chest of drawers but nowhere where to hung your clothes.  No fridge or tea and coffee facilities. I haven't tried water myself, but people said that water in Guatemala tastes awful, so bring couple of bottles from another Country if you can. Breakfast offers fruits, toast, eggs, french toast etc on a set menu between 40 and 80 quizales . I wasn't very impressed by my continental breakfast which included  a good portion of fruit but only two slices of bread and virtually inexistent butter or jam. Dinner is between 60 and 110 quizales but portions are rather small. If you order a 110 quizales meal, you can choose a soup and dessert which are"
10,"The worst experience in my life! I have been working in hospitality business the last 14years and I never felt so embarrassed like here. The staff unfriendly, unprofessional! The place have good location but nothing else! It’s build long time ago, no money turned back to renovate, improve or present 2018. You go there to pay accomondation, meals, and tours, receive nothing! They just want Your money overpricing everything! I recommend this place only if You have a weird taste of being treated as an unliked person! Who ever give higher then 2star to this place is eighter a liar or get payed for that! Do Yourself a favor and stay away this place!"
10,"Well, it is an absolute no go. The worst price-quality ratio I have ever experienced (and according to tripadvisor, I have traveled / backpacked a mere 30% of the world).  Disguising, dirty rooms with electricity being cut off sometime around 10:30pm and the staff gossiping in Spanish about the guests standing in front of them (I guess thinking the Guests do not understand Spanish - well, wrong assumption Guys). No. It is a very simple and honest NO.  The room is a no. The reception staff is a no. Maybe (maybe) the restaurant staff is ok.   ** Unless your absolute life dream is to see the sunrise over Tikal ruins, skip staying over in Tikal. Stay in Flores instead and do a day trip to Tikal."
20,"This is a prime location inside the Tikal park, with amazing surroundings and the tours to the ruins are within a walking distance.  Now, the hotel is a different story, service is less than poor and staff is undertrained.  Service in restaurant is very limited and closes at 21:00, so, if you arrive later than that, there is no dinner available, not even previously prepared sandwiches.  Mattresses and pillows are the worst in the entire industry, not able to relax at all.  Rooms are not equipped with any kind of basic stuff: no hangers for towels, no water was offered inside the rooms etc.  This could be an amazing hotel with a better management.  For the quality and service receives it is a very expensive hotel. Not recommended even by their personnel at the restaurant."
20,"I can't review staying in their hotel rooms because I didn't (though I now wish I had instead). I thought it would be great to stay in their tents and be ""one with nature."" I was wrong.  Although they set up their tents with a mattress and sheets, they are all on top of each other so you can hear everything in each of the tents and they can look in on you all night long. It's nice that they have public bathrooms, but those bathrooms have SO. MANY. TERRIFYING. BUGS. like, really jungle bugs everywhere because they don't close the doors ever. It's unbelievably hot so don't stay in these unless you're okay with sleeping in 95 degree humidity and getting bitten by mosquitos all night long (they will get inside your tent and also bite you while in the shower, there's no way around"
40,"This hotel is right next to the entrance to Tikal's monuments - a 2 minute walk away. No need to stay in Flores and wake up at 3am. The hotel is clean and basic. If nature interests you, you are right in the middle of the bush, lots of birds around too. The restaurant had a decent menu and the food was fine. Cold beers available at the end of the day! Its hot there, but we had a fan in our room. Facilities were not fancy, but they did the job.  I recommend this over staying in Flores and driving through for the day (I also stayed in Flores, totally different experience) - its relaxing and convenient."
40,"Hotel Jaguar Inn is a lovely setting and nicely maintained.  The food at the restaurant was just average and had few Guatemalan offerings.  The food would have been better if it had been local dishes instead of pasta, etc."
30,I am giving an average rating just because of the location. Been in Tikal several times and this are basic accommodations. Old place with a few changes. It is a great location and perfect place if you want to do the sunrise tour. Food is average at best. I prefer staying in Flores and drive or take a transfer when visiting Tikal
50,"We did not stay at this hotel but stayed in the Jaguar Inn in Flores and had a tour from this hotel.  We did eat at the hotel and found the food mediocre but fine.  The tour which was a private tour with a guide, Faviola who  was fantastic. She spoke fluent English and was enthusiastic and well educated in the local history and culture. She was amazing to have in Tikal and we thoroughly recommend her. I am not sure how much we paid but it wasn't excessive.   We went to Tikal at the end of July with three young children and toured from 10am - 2 PM. Mostly canopied walk and we were not too hot or humid. The children were thrilled and it was an exciting experience for all. Once of the best experiences of my life.  What was also nice was that at least 75 per cent of the parks"
20,"Comfortable king-sized bed left no room for seating or luggage; the wardrobe smelled of pesticide and mold. Delivery truck traffic right  outside room starts at 4 a.m. Broken mirror in very small bathroom.    “Service” in dining room frequently was very disorganized, some waiters quite competent while others hadn’t a clue whose table they were responsible for, and thinking the lemonade they brought was the daiquiri I ordered. No help moving luggage in or out of room 24.   Worst, management was dishonest in not agreeing to cancel and reimburse us for a final night, though we informed front desk more than 48 in advance. Victor tried to help, but head office refused even after Travelocity authorized the cancellation. Will see if Visa withholds the payment. "
50,"I have just returned from a stay at the Tikal Jungle Lodge - what a gem! A beautiful resort, set in the jungle, right on site at Tikal.  We loved everything about our stay. The rooms were comfortable and some were quite luxurious, depending on what was booked. My sister, for instance, had a gorgeous outdoor shower, a lovely patio and hot tub with her room. The resort strikes a nice balance between rustic and luxury (electricity is only available at certain times of the day, which is quite reasonable given the location), and the food was very good. The best was listening to the howler monkeys at night - a memorable experience! We loved our stay and would go back in a heartbeat!"
20,"Room 24: very small, no place to sit besides king bed, broken bathroom mirror, no decoration whatsoever, major truck noise right outside room at 4 a.m.  Service: often inept in dining room. No assistance whatsoever with baggage except at check-in.   Cancellation policy: we booked three nights via Travelocity. Upon arriving and learning about need for 5 a.m. departure to make connection to Rio Dulce, we told Kevin at front desk we wanted to cancel third night. He suggested we contact Travelocity, which we did but they informed us the lodge would not allow it despite 48 hr. notice. Kevin tried to be helpful but to no avail, then ultimately offered a room at their sister hotel, Hotel Isla de Flores, for the same relatively high price we were paying for Jungle Lodge. We chose lovely"
50,"This provided a true jungle experience during our visit to Tikal. Prepare to do a lot of walking. Comfortable shoes, flashlight, binoculars, sunscreen, hat, bug spray, water, snacks and a small day pack will be your best friends. There are power outages at different times of day, so if you wake up at 4 am to do the sunrise tour (you definitely should) you will need a flashlight. You also might want to have a portable phone charger as you will be taking lots of photos and videos but may also need your phone for the flashlight. The pool area is lovely and while sitting relaxing in the pool, we saw spider monkeys swinging branch to branch above us! A nice welcome of things to come! Wish we had another night as it was truly unique and special."
40,"Jungle Lodge is just 50 meters away from the park entrance: excellent location for sunrise / sunset in Tikal ! Rooms / bathrooms are confortable, food average despite friendly staff.  Swimming pool is small however very refreshing after a few hours under the sun, and as the lodge is located in the jungle, you will see plenty of animals. Bar, board games, foosball or pool will keep everybody busy after the cultural visit"
50,"Tikal was the best historical sites I have visited for several resons, I have never had so much freedom to explore a site as I did at Tikal.  There were few crowds even on Saturday and  you have the choice to take a guided tour or to go on your own.  Lots of good info avaliable from books or guess who go there on a regular bases.  Sunrise was amazing, it came up behind several of the temples but took three days to see it because of fog. The sunset was nice but seen from the back of Temple IV.  Some people can stay for four hours and see everything they're interested in but even after three days I could have been there longer.  Transportation from Flores, two nights camping at the Jaguar Inn (using thier tent, air mattresses and blanket) and food/drink was only about Q350.  About"
50,"its that it is the only way to see the temples the way they ought to be seen, at sunrise and sunset, on a budget. there is 2 lodges, but they are quite pricey for a backpacker budget. I had a truck so it was perfect. the local transportation does not get here that early, and if you want to feel as though you have it to yourself this is the ticket. I got up at 6am and jogged out to the grand plaza,climbed the temple. I had the place and the sunrise to myself for at least a half hour. it was the best half hour of my life....."
50,"One cannot help feeling transported to precolombine times. Before any other place of the mayan cities, this is the one to visit this 2012. People, accommodations and service are no problem at all; in fact they contribute to the overall epicness of the park. I really hope I can visit Tikal this December and be a part of this amazing upcoming event."
40,"If you're trying to do Tikal on the cheap, the campground is the place to go. You can't make reservations in advance, but try to arrive in Tikal by late morning to get a spot. The people at the lodges might tell you that the campground has no tents, but if you're persistent, someone should point you in the direction of a clearing in the woods where there is, in fact, an open campground. I believe the nightly rate is something like 70q for a hammock, 110q for a tent (can sleep up to two). The hammocks, tents, and concrete shelter are provided. The service is wonderful with a very friendly grounds-keeper who will give you tips about the best (and cheapest) way to see Tikal at sunrise and the best (and cheapest) place to eat a good hearty meal. This is definitely not the most"
40,"We stayed for just one night but it provided a great location as opposed to staying in Flores and commuting here. We had Cesar as our guide for our sunset tour (sunset is far better than sunrise) and he was superb! If you can get him, please do. He studied world history in college and is able to draw parallels between Mayan development and other ancient civilizations. He is entertaining and knows the ins and outs of the jungle.   The hotel food is quite good and the rooms are good. It's not the cheapest option but we decided it was worth it as it saved us a significant amount of time."
20,"We stayed in the Jaguar Inn in Tikal for a couple of days. Let's start with the pros: The property itself is beautiful and well kept. Located inside the park and a short 3 minute walk from the entrance to the archeological ruins section. It's very convenient for access to the park so you can avoid the 1 hour drive to and from Flores (if you're staying in a hotel in Flores). The food is very good and a little bit expensive but not as bad as some other places. Staff in the restaurant and reception were very nice and were able to accommodate us to a different room when we asked them to, but they never helped us move room. The room turned out to be nicer and bigger though. Our tour guide, Bayron was very very nice and knowledgeable. I highly recommend him. I also highly recommend"
50,"We had a great room at a very reasonable price.  Comfortable, clean, 24 hour electricity and hot water, friendly staff (Especially Carlos, the manager), excellent food at a reasonable cost, lovely setting in the middle of the forest with monkeys and other animals roaming the treetops and garden."
40,We stayed there because it is in the park and at dawn we could walk into the central plaza of the Tikal ruins when no-one else was there. 25 minutes easy walk and shared only with the birds and monkeys. Hotel is comfortable enough although they turn off the generator from about 10 pm to 6 am and it's hot without the fan.
50,"Loved our short stay here.  Minutes from the entrance to the ruins, clean rooms, good but overpriced restaurant, hammocks to swing in and plenty of wildlife around you. They organise tours here for a decent price it seems and offer free wifi (although doesn't always work).   Would recommend this hotel for couples or families visiting Tikal.  "
40,"We spent one night here while we explored Tikal. It is very close & you can walk to the site, or take free  transportation. Also, we did the sunrise tour of Tikal, which goes from here. It was great, too, but you should bring your own flashlight. Roaming through the jungle in the pitch black with only the guide carrying a light, is a bit tricky. The cabin was really nice. Our room (#10) was very clean, comfy beds, beautiful bathroom with great shower & a little deck to sit on & watch monkeys in the trees. The whole area is gorgeous with beautiful plants, little pathways & lots of wildlife. They turn off the power at certain times, not that this was a problem for us. You can only get WiFi in the main building & it a bit slow. There was a faint septic smell when we sat on our deck"
50,I just spent a overnight at Jungle Lodge Hoteland Hostel in Tikal. It has been without a doubt an extraordinary experience. The service is amazing. A professional and efficient staff. The food is superb and the rooms are top notch. Annabella Ortiz the manager invited meand my three girls to stay there and we are impressed with their hotel. Truly a memorable vidit to be chetished a lifetime!! We also did the Sunrise Tour . A breathtaking experience!!!  Annabella Ruiz
40,Very comfortable accommodation in semi-detached bungalows deep in the jungle. Power limited to one light and fan during part of the day. A1 bathroom with both bath and shower. Excellent breakfast and good dinner if limited choice. Friendly and helpful staff if knowledge limited 're food and drink.
40,"We stayed here only one night in cabana 18. Quite a beautiful room - nicer than I expected - plus a huge bathroom.   As previously mentioned, they do not have 24/7 power but it didn’t matter to us much. I wouldn’t say we had the best sleep - loud howler monkeys woke us up several times (not the fault of the lodge, of course) and it was very hot and stuffy in the room even though the fan worked through the night. Couldn’t get much in the way of hot water from the shower but didn’t want a hot shower anyhow, so it was fine.   We had dinner, drinks in the bar and breakfast here. Dinner was good and reasonably priced. I had the best breakfast of my trip so far also - the “perfect combination” breakfast. Restaurant staff also accommodated my apparently unusual request for a coffee to"
50,Great first impression very welcoming. Nice looking lobby! Views from room are amazing. Great rooms with Aircon and big bed. Would stay here longer if possible. Amazing location. Already seen many animals on the way in. :)
30,"The location was excellent-- just a few minutes walk to the entrance of the park. The room was comfortable. The pool looked inviting, although we did not have time to use it. The reason I am giving a  3 rating is mostly because I found the staff very impersonal.  Our experience at the restuarant, especially for dinner, was not enjoyable. We stood for 10 minutes, before anyone acknowledged us, it took a long time for dinner to be served, and the waiter (who probably was overworked) was not attentive.."
10,"This small hotel in the impressive Tikal Archaeological Park is in a great position for exploring the Mayan sites, but otherwise is disappointing .  There is a small swimming pool and restaurant. Although the hotel had hardly any guests we were put in a room in a block on the outskirts of the property in what seemed to be staff quarters . The accommodation was basic to say the least, with electricity and hot water only working for a few hours each day. The walls were paper thin and we were kept awake by noise of other people talking and laughing during the night.  The information we were given about access to the hotel and park entrance was confusing. Restaurant staff were pleasant but otherwise reception and service was poor.  We were persuaded to buy a package for a set meal"
10,"We stayed for 3 nights exploring Tikal and surrounding areas 27-30 October in room C -14 it's far remote area of the hotel, outside of everything, 10 min walk thought the jungle with no lights and road from the main lobby.   I went out of the room for WIFI in the lobby 29 October around 8:30 pm and going to check-in for my morning flight to Guatemala City. I was seating in the lobby for not more than 20-30 min. I always put my valuables inside the locked suitcase, but not for this time I forgot my wallet inside my day backpack with 100Euro and 150USD inside, when I came back my wallet was empty. Door of the room was closed, these guys have your rooms key ( probably reception provides it or room service for a fee )  and searching for your valuables while you are surfing the"
20,"Maybe we caught them on a bad day but this place left a lot to be desired. I'm a backpacking traveler with very basic needs.  We booked the sunrise tour ahead of time through their website for the morning after our arrival. We arrived in the evening after the park ticket office closed. So because we had reserved through their website, we thought they'd have our tickets, separate sunrise ticket, and guide (through hotel) all sorted and ready to go. Note - The sunrise tour starts at 4am but the ticket office opens at 6am, so you must buy the park ticket and special sunrise ticket the day before...or the hotel needs to do it for you. They did not. But they did not tell us that we did not have tickets until we were standing at the park entrance at 4:15am. So we woke up at 3:30am for"
50,"We did the sunrise tour  with  Cesar and he was great. His passion for the Maya culture and Tikal was unbelievable. You must do the sunrise tour and hear ,see the jungle waking up.Theres wildlfe everywhere. Your appreciation for the Maya culture will only grow."
50,"I loved the park it self it's beautiful,when we arrived I made the huge mistake to take the first tour guide, I highly recommend a tour Guide because they do explain everything in detail and take you to every building without wasting time I been in other ruins in yucatan and always have a very good experience with the guides, unfortunately the first Tour guide we took wasn't very informative and look like more in a hurry that passionate about his job, next day we set up for the sunrise tour and we had Cesar this time he is an awesome guide, he explains every thing so well and with so much passion, I knew about this guy because his becoming famous for his good job but if you ask anybody in the park no one is going to tell u were he is because they want the job, please look for"
50,"The place had cozy and clean rooms. No AC (but no problem). The garden was well maintained. The park was nearby. The food was expensive so go to the nearby Comidor and make sure to get a Naranja. There was a small market nearby, where you could get souvenirs."
30,Not a great experience. Try to find some more local accommodations in town. For one night and if you want to see the sunrise it's ok. Breakfast it's ok when you came back from the tour. If you want a tour take a tour operator for the park.
50,"It is not a 5 star hotel, but you have everything you need considering you are in the National Park of Tikal. The fan was adequade ( no AC) even in the hottest month of May.Staying so close to the impressive place of Tikal gives you the opportunity to get up really early (sunrise and sunset tours cost extra, as the day tickets are valid between 6 am and 6 pm) but even daytickets allow you to be there before the crowds arrive and go back after they have left. You can relax in the hammock infront of your bungalow with a cold drink during the hottest and bussiest time around the tempels."
30,"Whilst I might say that the hotel facilities are average or just above, it was more than acceptable for the location to the Tikal National Park and the early start for the dawn tour. Food was fine and the staff friendly and helpful."
50,"My wife and I stayed for two nights in one of the newer deluxe cabanas at Jungle Lodge Hotel and were delighted with our experience. The room itself was spacious and stylishly decorated with murals of jungle animals and fruits inspired by Maya art. The hotel grounds are beautifully planted and well maintained, and the open-air restaurant is surrounded by vegetation. We took all our meals at this restaurant, which consistently served interesting and tasty regionally inspired dishes. Tickets for park entry, and bookings for special tours (sunrise, sunset) can be arranged from the front desk, although it's important to note you must pay cash for most of these (this is park policy). The guide we retained through the hotel was excellent, courteous and knowledgeable about birds and"

The owners’ respect for the environment and rich heritage is evident & hugely refreshing; there is no commercialization near the hotel. I visited 25 years -it has been updated but remains in keeping with the remote reality of this amazing cultural crucible. The lodge has lush landscaping, stone pathways & attractive bungalows with a front porch, comfy beds & modern baths. Electricity is not “ON” 24 hours; no TVs, WIFI or room phones. Pack a flashlight–it is dark as pitch. Lodge has a dining area, reception, sitting area, bar and game room with WIFI. It is open air building honoring the original footprint. The hotel is steps away from the path"
40,"We loved our little ""cottage"" which nestled amongst the greenery of the surrounding  forest. It was very quiet and peaceful .  We were free to come and go within Tikal because this lodge is situated inside the site itself. Our room was clean, cosy and very  comfortable. We had some issues with the temperature of the water in the shower (cold) but it did not affect our enjoyment of our stay. Food was a little basic and  unimaginitive but the location made up for any negatives."
40,I stayed here for 3 nights with my girlfriend while we explored Tikal. The accommodations were a bit spartan but the place was reasonably priced. The food was good despite some reviews on here to the contrary.  The guides agreed that this was the best hotel of the 3 available in Tikal.
50,"Situated right at the entrance to Tikal National park. Very clean modern rooms, with seating areas outside. Clean comfortable beds and good quality linens and towels. The shared showers and bathrooms the cleanest and most modern I have ever seen. Efficient room fan and mosquito nets. Swimming pool area very comfortable with towels provided, and views of various birds and monkeys in the trees. Only downside was the WiFi doesn't reach the rooms, but other than that excellent value. Dinner in the restaurant was pretty poor, so we didn't bother after the first night. "
50,"This place is really situated 100m to the entrance to Tikal. Quiet,descent place to take a rest after full day in Tikal. Kitchen is very good. Prices for a breakfast started from 50Q. 330ml beer cost 24Q.  There is only 1,5h morning and 3h evenig time for electricity in rooms, but remember - you're in the middle of the jungle. Daily cleaning, friendly & helpful staff. Very nice owner, we talk with her for a while. Definitely recommend."
30,"The location was wonderful. It's within the park. The birds, monkeys and plants are right there. You are easy walking distance to the entrance. The hotel itself was clean. We had hot water & a fan during the 2 periods of electricity a day.  Remember that you are in the middle of the rain forest. They only have a generator. There is a pool and a bar. The food is OK but not gourmet which is pretty standard for all of Guatemala. Guatemala is not noted for it's cuisine. I did enjoy the fruit for desert, At breakfast we had fresh squeezed OJ too. The service at the desk was great. It's a good value. I would add that I would highly recommend Roxy Ortiz as your guide. She is a professional archeologist. Currently she lives at the Inn & trains their guides but her tours are separate"
40,"A friendly welcome and good facilities make this hotel a good pick for Tikal. restaurant  had a nice relaxed atmosphere  I had the grilled fish and a beer. My room was spacious with a nice big bathroom. There are a variety of room types so select one that best matches your needs,  pool side cabins looked good, and the regular rooms were nice.  Make sure you do the sunrise tour the hotel offers, its a great way to explore  the Tikal National park with  friendly guide"
40,"Yes, there was limited wifi and electricity, not the poshest hotel room I've ever been in, but we were in the jungle of Guatemala! Such an amazing experience. Just ten steps from our hotel room was a family of spider monkeys playing in the trees. Hotel staff was helpful and food was yummy. The highlight of the stay is the sunrise tour to see the ruins. Just breathtaking to watch and hear the jungle wake up as the sun rose, from the top of a Mayan temple."
40,"Location is great for visiting Tikal, rooms are clean, restaurant is good and grounds/pool are nice for relaxing after hiking the ruins. When we stayed, electricity was only on a couple hours in the morning and a few more hours at night. Cell reception was minimal and WiFi was available only in the lobby, and sometimes a bit slow - all good in my book. Wake up to howler monkeys and parrots in the morning. "
10,It was 4 of us that decided to watch the sunset and sunrise at Tikal n.p. so we took a camping place in the Jaguar Inn Hotel. The rudness and the way they treated us was completely unrespectful. Just because we hadn t a room didn t mean that they were allowed to switch off the lights leaving us in the complete darkness at 9.30pm after asking us twice laughing and pushing us to go bed when we were still having our dinner   and enjoying the beauty and silence of the n.p.  Plus before going to bed some workers asked us 3 times if we paid.  Badly organized and rude. This is what i felt.
40,"The room was clean, comfortable, hot water and safe. We were lucky the night was cool so ceiling fan was fine.. Because hey have no ac. Good that Internet service only in lobby and restaurant .. The food at the restaurant was very good. The best part was that we could walk into Tikal National Park.. That was fantastic.. We got an excellent guide Cesar Moran. He was awesome we did the tour before sunrise.. I recommend this hotel and it's services ."
40,"After a 3 day trek through the jungle we arrived to stay the night here, anything was going to be better than a tent in the jungle as long as it had running water! What a pleasant surprise though, I really did only expect basic but this hotel albeit small with only 10 cabins is really nice.   All the buildings and hotels in Tikal have to ration the electricity and therefore hot water, you only get 2 hours in the morning and another 2 in the evening but this didn't spoil anything, in fact it adds to the charm of the place.  All the staff are helpful and charming. We had a couple of meals in the restaurant over the two days and all the food was great, good choices and tasty. The grounds are kept clean and tidy and of course open to the wildlife, eating your lunch with a Pizote"
50,"The Jaguar Inn was an awesome place to stay!  The hotel is an easy walk to the national park, and is incredibly quaint with charming cabins and lovely gardens.  The atmosphere is very relaxing with amazing birds and monkeys throughout the grounds."
50,"Proximity is the selling point of this hotel - it is right on Tikal's doorstep. We did the sunrise tour with them and it was amazing - highly recommended. Watching the rising sun is unparalleled. It was also cool to walk around in the dark - we saw more animals, even a snake (eeeeek - but it was tiny). You need to stay near Tikal to do those tours so that's the main recommendation for this place. They were very helpful in organizing other activities like horseback riding and a zip-line tour for us. The food was decent. The bed was comfortable and the room was a pleasant temperature. Not too many frills in the room, but who cares when you're on nature's doorstep? The gardens were beautiful, I even got a photo of a hummingbird."
40,"The hotel is in a great location but we had read on trip that the food was stupidly expensive and the service was poor . We were surprised to get a nice room in the jungle , the staff were helpful and friendly and the food was good value for money . I have no idea why so many people think that food prepared in a remote jungle lodge should cost the same as food in a dusty large town near the port or airport . They have prime location for their restaurant , but we still thought the breakfast and dinner stacked up well on price with better restaurants in Antigua or Belize.  Sitting on our outside deck drinking the Gin and tonic we brought in was great every evening , listening to the jungle noises in the dark   So, a good 2 night stay and great access to Tikal . I would definitely"
40,"The lodge is in a great location, right beside the entrance to Tikal's mayan site. The lodge and cabins are surrounded by jungle gardens, full of wildlife. The cabins were a decent size, with everything required. The beds were comfy and the ceiling fans cool the rooms very well. The food was good, and one of the few places with an a la carte menu but the service was variable. The main issue was that most of the restaurant staff spoke no English at all and we struggled to make ourselves understood. Given the number of tourists, especially Americans visiting, I was a bit surprised at this.  My tip would be to have a guide to get the best out of the ruins - the site is huge and they know which are the best bits and short cuts around the site. "
30,"The Jungle Lodge is probably the best hotel in the park. To be fair, the rooms are nice and modern and so are the showers. WiFi is decent.  Service is bad and arrogant. There was one guide who seems to be working from or for the hotel who even  wanted us to leave the temple from  were one watches the sunset despite the fact that we had paid for the privilege and had also a receipt for the guide, who only showed up much later - if we had not been stubborn and refused we would have missed the sunset.  The restaurant food is ok, but nothing special and the waiters can be rather dismissive.  A few tips:  Be sure that you explicitly request a airport pick up (normally shared), particularly if you arrive with the late flight at 7pm. Be mindful that the return shuttle to Flores or the"
50,"We recently spent 3 nights here in order to explore the magnificent Tikal remains. Our ‘junior suite’ was clean and comfortable with a large, well-equipped bathroom. The cabaña was very private, surrounded by jungle and plentiful wildlife including spider and howler monkeys in the trees above us. It provided a great jungle experience at the edge of the National Park.  The pool looked inviting but we didn’t use it. The staff were friendly and helpful but service in the restaurant was slow at times.  The restaurant menu was good and we enjoyed our dinners and breakfasts there.   At reported elsewhere the electricity is turned off at certain times of the day. This didn’t worry us and there was always hot water in the shower when we needed it.  I would thoroughly recommend the"
30,"A great location but service at dinner could be improved. Main course served whilst still eating starter is a mistake that can not happen at these prices. “Black” and “white” brigade should know that main courses can not be send out 3 minutes after sending out the starters. Training inexperienced staff is always good but at least teach them the basics properly. Again, prices are not cheap( which is fine) but therefore you expect a decent level of service from both brigades."
40,"There are only three hotels to choose from in this area, and from reviews I had read they all leave a bit to be desired.  We chose Tikal Inn, and opted for one of the budget hotel rooms.  It was pretty well what I expected, and it was a cheap price,so my only main complaint was the bed linen which was very average.  The food was okay, certainly not gourmet, but not bad either.  The grounds and the pool are lovely and it is very atmospheric being in the middle of the jungle. The huge bonus though is getting to be at Tikal late in the afternoon when all the crowds are gone, and on location for sunrise in the morning instead of having to drive in from El Remate or Flores.  Sunset and sunrise are not to be missed experiences."
50,"We stayed here for 3 nights and it was a little too long for us, but thankfully the pool made up for it. So why it was too long was like many tourist places around the world, food and drink here were higher than national average. Also it was so hot and without AC and since the fan cuts at 9, sleeping was a little tough for me. BUT my biggest problem was the way tickets to the park (out of hotels control) are issued. The ticketing service to Tikal was taken over by a national bank and so its a big complicated to understand and unfortunately not a good value. I'll try and break it down below:  1 ticket to enter the ruins is Q150 and is only valid from 6am-6pm which ever day you choose and you can enter as many times as you wish within that period.  Now if you want to do sunrise"
50,stayed for a couole of nights as part of a travel agent's package hotel basic but so great to be on site and cohld visit it after all of the buses of tourists had left nice to have pool on site but rooms were basic
50,"Although the place is on the wild side, being so close to the park, it is a great way to rest and relax after walking all day.  We have stayed here twice in the last two years, arriving in the late afternoon after touring the park and then leaving in the morning.  The howler monkeys at night, no power in the evening, and presence of jungle bugs may be off putting to some.  But, the location can't be beat.  While there, we have enjoyed the pool, the spacious rooms, and both dinner (which can be pricey) and breakfast."
50,"This hotel was exactly what we needed it to be for a 2 night stay in Tikal.  We arrived at around 4 pm one day, did the sunrise and sunset tours the next, the left the morning of the third.  The hotel accommodations were actually better than I expected and the pool was nice and refreshing, especially since the temps were over 100 degrees.  The sunrise tour expecially was the highlight of my entire vacation and I look forward to taking my children back there someday.  The food was just ok, however I didn't have any better experience in Guatemala and while we were there we ate mostly at the small restaurants near the entrance of the park, which were a tad cheaper.  Either way, I would recommend the Tikal Inn to anyone wanting to truly experience Tikal and do the sunrise and sunset"
40,"Don't expect luxury, but if you want clean comfortable accommodation in an amazing locale, this will do the trick. If you have an interest in history, a few hours in Tikal isn't enough, so we appreciated having a day and a half to explore the park and avoid the midday tour crowds in the most popular areas. The electricity in the night was great for charging cameras and phones. The hot water is limited, and was available for one of the five showers we had in the two days we were there, but the air was was warm enough that it wasn't a big deal. The restaurant is fine overall, and the chicken pita was great. It was convenient to be able to charge everything to the room, since there aren't any ATMs in town. The desk was also able to change money for us."
40,Perfect for doing the sunrise tour of Tikal. Very comfortable and clean. Great service and a nice area for sitting outside and meeting new people. The guide will meet you right at the hotel for your tour.
20,"Intentionally choose this hotel based on recommendations and to have the benefit of direct access without the tour from Flores.  The room was sufficiently large, no wardrobe or locker.  The bathroom was reasonably clean but would benefit from some thorough cleaning exercise.  I did not miss an A/C, but that there was no power from the evening until the next morning so even the fan didn't work.   Yes, there was a thunderstorm, but I understand that they used to generate there power themselves so they should have had power back-up  I booked that as part of the experience.  The food in the restaurant was ok, the service even on local standards was below reasonable expectation.  Overall the location is very exclusive, the hotel not."
50,"First of all you must consider that this hotel is located in the middle of the jungle! That there is wlan is just a wonder and that it didn't worked all the time is totally acceptable! Also there was no electricity during the night, which is totally fine as you really don't need it there! The food in the restaurant was delicious and the stuff really really friendly! The room was nice and clean. We booked the sunrise and sunset tour and the guide was very friendly and we were on sunset the only guests and on sunrise were 4 people more! I would definitly recommend it!!"
50,"For all your Tikal visitation needs, this place has it. From budget tent-camping to private rooms (we stayed in a four-bed room with private bath), all on beautifully maintained grounds, complete with a restaurant with good food and wi-fi, albeit slow (but fast enough to make your next booking). Cesar is an excellent guide and is fluent in English, which helps around the place (he arranged special timing with a minimal-English driver for our ride to Flores). We took his sunrise tour.  The hotel is close to the welcome center, souvenir shops, and the entrance to the ruins. You can check out a section, come back for lunch, then go back out. We showered at night and in the morning and had hot water both times."
50,Situated inside the Tikkal National Park the Jungle Lodge is ideal to have fist hand experience of staying in a jungle environment. We were woken in the morning by the monkeys howling above and during the day watching their playfull antics from one tree to another. During our two night stay our guide took us around the historical site. Cobbled paths lead to well equipped lodges. Wi fi connection rather poor. Friendly service in the restaurant.
50,"We stayed at Jungle Lodge for 2 nights, a group of 6 older women traveling together. We were unexpectedly upgraded to premium rooms as a large college group needed placement near each other. Our rooms were superb- each with a private outdoor space with a jacuzzi, relaxing chairs, and visiting monkey in the trees. The bathroom was spacious with a glassed in tub, and a separate indoor shower that connected to an outdoor shower. Beds were comfortable and there was a sofa and chair sitting area as well. We loved the proximity to the park. The restaurant at the lodge was beautifully designed and the food and service commendable. The is also a pool with plenty of lounge seating around it, although the water was too cool to swim in while we were there. "
50,"The Jungle Lodge is a literal paradise in the middle of the jungle, the rooms were clean, the water hot and the food simply amazing. The place offers a lot of activities to enjoy as a group and the pool was a dream. The staff is always friendly and ready to give a helping hand. 10/10 would recommend!"
50,"If you are looking for the best hotel in Tikal, Guatemala, you need to stay at Jungle Lodge. This hotel is in the Tikal National Park, and sits immediately outside the entrance into the Tikal Mayan ruins. The rooms are very clean and comfortable. The food is excellent and the staff is extremelly helpfull and acomodating."
50,"My God I need to share this  that staying in this amazing Hotel was a wonderful experience  Start with the people and service they great and happy  very helpful  The food was delicious and very healthy they have a variety of meals and I enjoy the drinks at the beautiful pool My suite was more that what I aspect beautiful bathroom and the out shower was amazing I can see the monkeys from my patio beautiful hotel I was surprise to have a luxurious at the jungle, thank you to all this wonderful people that made my vacations amazing see you again next year "
20,"The hotel is OK. It has a nice pool and the location is great. The room are basic and the decoration is quite old without any charm. You can feel that it has not been maintained for quite a while.  The restaurant is AWFUL,  we had half board with my wife and thus had dinner at the restaurant. Had the choice of 4 dish. I had Fajitas and it was absolutely disgusting,  so bad I could not finish it (first time in many year that it happen) same for my wife. The service was not very good either,  we asked for a Caipirinia and half of the team did not know what it was... the staff at the reception is OK but at the restaurant they all look miserable. I think they know that they are serving dog food. In short,  OK for a night to enjoy the sunrise at tikal,  but avoid the food their and"
10,"We arrived on a Friday recently on a night Flight from Flores. I paid a whooping $60 for my friend and I to get picked up from the airport at 8pm, for safety I shelled out the money. The shuttle driver was on time but as we were driving up to Tikal inn which sits inside the national park right next to the entrance of the ruins ,we quickly realized we should have stayed in Flores. The driver kept telling us that we will need tickets to enter the National Park. Driving up the dark road I mentioned to him that there was no mention of having national park tickets on hand on the website. I had signed up for the next mornings sunrise tour and therefore we must be covered right ? No reassurance from him he said I will see what I can tell the guard. Shocked and scared we got through the"
30,"The hotel is quite small and has limited facilities, albeit totally sufficient if you know what to expect: a cool down in the pool, a bed an something to eat after a burning hot and tiring day in or around Tikal. None of them exceptional,  suits the needs.), price is too high. Location is perfect though, certainly for an early morning park visit! "
50,"Since Hotel Tikal is in Tikal National Park we could enter the ruins early to see sunrise over the temples. Our guide, Roxy, was extremely knowledgeable. She is an archeologist and very informative about animals, birds, etc. in addition to intensive information about the ruins."
50,"We spent 2 nights here as part of an organised bird-watching tour and never had time to sample the inviting looking pool.  As well as plenty of excellent birdwatching there are also the mayan ruins to explore, and plenty of tourist shops - be prepared to he harassed!  The electric does go off at night which is not unusual in Guatemala, and there is an emergency light, but it helps if you have a torch with you"
40,"If you are looking for a wheelchair accessible hotel in Tikal, Guatemala, you might want to consider the Jungle Lodge.  This hotel is in the Tikal National Park, and sits immediately outside the entrance into the Tikal Mayan ruins.  The rooms are very clean and comfortable.  You are likely to hear many sounds of the jungle at night, including Howler Monkeys.  The lodge has wheelchair accessible rooms, that have full access to bathrooms and shower.  The road into the lodge and between the lobby and the rooms is cobblestone and terribly difficult to roll on with a wheelchair (I had to do wheelies to get from my room to the lobby).  The food in the lodge is good.  The staff are not incredibly helpful, but not rude."
50,"We stayed at Jungle Lodge in January and we had an incredible time!   First, the rooms are specious and nicely decorated. They are in the middle of the jungle and they have a private jacuzzi which is perfect to finish a long day walking in the amazing city of Tikal.  If you love wildlife and insects, this is the place to be! We saw anteaters, monkeys, toucans, tarantulas and more!   Second, its super close to Tikal ruins. So it is very convenient if you are doing the sunrise or sunset tours (I highly recommend both!)  I would stay here again if I return and I highly recommend it!!!"
40,"Enjoyed our stay here in the jungle. The rooms were very comfortable, clean and we appreciated the mosquito netting over each bed. The bathrooms have been recently remodeled and are beautiful. One of the nicest bathrooms on our month long trip. Even though there is no internet in the bungalows there are lots of comfy chairs and couches in the lobby area and by the pool where there is internet service. The pool area was lovely and the howler monkeys were in the trees above us. Loved experiencing Tikal early in the morning when it was cool and very few people. We saw lots of wildlife around too. Thought the on-site restaurant was good especially the breakfast! Would highly recommend staying a night here to experience the jungle and Tikal when less crowed. "
50,"Beautiful setting, well appointed rooms, comfort in the jungle, good restaurant. Easy transport arranged from Flores.  Short walk into the park.  My friends and I had a wonderful stay.  I’d easily go back."
50,"Outstanding service, great location and very knowledgeable + attentive staff. Had an amazing experience staying in the heart of the action with easy access to the park, prearranged private tours (ask for Roni) of the Mayan ruins, and a relaxing place to unwind during downtime. Will suggest any overnight visitors to Tikal take advantage of this gem! Can't say enough what a fantastic experience."
40,"The location in the park was very important to us. We wanted to be able to visit sites both early and late in the day, without a lot of road travel to get to them; the comfortable but basic accommodations perfectly met our needs. It was a very big plus to be able to take a midday break in our rooms, or around the pool. Staying in Flores for either cheaper or nicer accommodations would not have been a worthwhile trade-off for us.  We stayed in the bungalows, and requested the forest view rather than the pool view units because they are generally quieter and more private.   The hotel restaurant offers a fixed price meal option, which was reasonable both in cost and quality. Be sure to ask if it isn’t obvious – our guide Roxy pointed it out to us on our arrival. There were enough"
40,"Tikal Inn is a nice spot to relax and unwind from a hot day or days spent at the ruins. The rooms are very hot and humid, but that's to be expected in the heart of canopy rain forest. There is no AC that I know of, but there is a very nice pool that really helps cool you down. There are a bunch of jungle critters all around the place, coatis, monkeys, etc and the bird life is amazing. Lots of toucans and other colourful birds I couldn't identify. The walk to the temples is very short and enjoyable."
40,"This is a really pretty hotel that offers lots of services like tours to Tikal (sunrise ($22), sunset, and during the day), tours to Yaxhá ($75) and to Uaxactun. Our guide, Cesar, was awesome.  We felt safe on the tour with him. He spoke great English, and he knew his stuff. He also allowed us to take our time during the tour, even if that meant having it last two hours longer than it was supposed to. (If you are planning to do a sunrise tour, be sure to get your entries into the park in advance! There is a separate entrance fee for sunrise tours and you don´t want to find that out at 4 am when you´re trying to get into the park with the wrong entrance ticket.) The restaurant in the hotel is OK. It will be your only option for food in the park, so it´s good that the food is"
40,The Tikal Inn is a great place to stay while visiting the ruins of Tikal is about a 10 min walk to the entrance of the park. The Hotel is basic but it has all you need. One thing of note is in a remote are and electricity is only available from 6;30 am till 9;30 am and from 6;30pm till 10;00pm> WiFi is limited to the lobby only
40,"It is right next to Tikal, so you are able to walk there several times a day and dip in a pool in between. You can observe toucans and parrots right on the hotel grounds as the jungle is all around.  The accomodation is quite basic and the restaurant is quite bad (and sometimes infested with flies) - you clearly pay for the location. But the staff was professional and they offer great sunset tours - 20 bucks and the dinner is included."
10,"No air-conditioning, noisy fan, hot water only available for a few hours per day, nobody at the front desk after 22:00, unusably slow internet, small portions and high prices at the restaurant. This would be acceptable for a 15€/night hostel but not for a 100€/night hotel."
50,"Loved this place so much, the room was clean and the bed was so comfortable. It was very hot so the ac and fan were the best. A must to do in Tikal the sunrise or sunset tour. Cesar is one the best guides ive ever meet. Seeing the Temple I under the stars was an expierence that literally took my breath away. I feel in love with Tikal and I cant wait to go back"
40,"We stayed in tents that they had set up. It was a good bed to sleep on and they had tents of all sizes. They drove to our next destination. There were showers, but they were kind of bad. Did exchange money and had things at front desk. 4 and a half stars! Great location too."
50,We slept in there tents that they provided. They had a mattress with a pillow and a sleeping bag to keep you warm. The restaurant was right by the tents and the hotel rooms in. I would give it 5 dots any day of the week.
30,"Yes, in a very nice location to explore from.  The rooms leave a whole lot to be desired for the price.  Extremely humid mattresses.  Again, its the jungle...but wow.  Really difficult to sleep.  We did meet a fantastic guide there in the lobby named Jose.  Super informative tour. The staff at the hotel are very slow.  I don't mind but it was really pronounced when we were there.  Their transfer system for getting back to Belize could use a little work. It was fun though!  There aren't much for options right there so I doubt they will find need to change anything."
50,"Stayed here for a night in order to do the Tikal Sunrise Tour. Staff was super friendly and attentive. The setting is in the middle of the jungle so you fall asleep to the sounds of Howler Monkeys.  Tikal was pretty magical and a completely different setting than many other ruins I have visited. It is now personal favorite over Chichén Itzá, Palenque, Bonampak, Teotihuacan, and a few other ruins I have visited.   Since the hotel is located within the confines of the Tikal park, you either need to buy your Tikal ticket ahead of time or buy it at the gate (about 30 minutes driving distance from the hotel). They don't take card so make sure you have cash!"
40,This hotel is next to Tikal so you can easily see the sunrise at Tikal.  Our room was a nicely appointed cabin and comfortable for our family of four.   Experiencing the park early or late in the day is ideal.  We also enjoyed our meals. We hired a guide through the hotel and he was really good.  The electricity is off certain hours so pay attention. 
40,"We stayed there when we visited the Tikal site. The lodge is right by the entrance of the site. Room were nice, beds comfortable. Large bathrooms and no issue with water. The windows are only screened so it got cold in the room, the night temperature hit 13 degrees. Since there were 2 beds in the room, we took the blankets from the second one and we were fine. Restaurant food was ok, service was poor at the restaurant. It took us 45 minutes for pancakes, and there was only 1 other table at that time. Had the same issue the previous night. Looked at the pool, water level was well below skimmer so we decided not to try it. Being in the park and right by the entrance and able to walk to the site was why I gave it a 4.."
50,"We were blown away by the lovely spot only steps to the entranceway to the Tikal site. Absolutely lovely. We stayed in one of the cabins. Very luxurious king size bed with extra blankets against the cool evenings. You are right in the middle of the jungle, so it was delightful to see Coatimundis wandering the property, Spider Monkeys dangling from nearby trees and hear the eerie calls of Howler Monkeys. We heard that jaguars even come as close as the edge of the swimming pool platform, although we didn't experience that. We chose the sunset tour of Tikal with a very informed Mayan heritage guide. Thank goodness he was with us as we returned down totally black paths after dark with only flashlights to guide us. The jungle is alive! We saw howler monkeys, a fox, another coatimundi"
50,"If you want a jungle experience complete with Toucan's, Spyder and Howler Monkeys this is the right place. The added bonus is the largest Mayan ruins in the Yucatan Penninsula. It is truly a oasis complete with great Margaritas after exploring all day. The food, service and location were perfect."
40,Room ok but hospitality of the staff was key to our very enjoyable stay. And a big thank you to Cesar for the sunrise trip to the park - magical and not to be missed. A visit to Guatemala would be incomplete without a trip to Tikal
40,"Pre-Hotel: Get there before dark. We had unforseen delays from Flores and had to take the most expensive option to Tikal just before sunset: taxi. We got in to gate at sunset, still light, and had to have the taxi wait for about 20 min while my boyfriend paid our entrance fee and had to change US for Belize dollar at the gate as well because we didn't have enough BZ (we thought we could change it at hotel, but gate is before hotel). Finally we got in and taxi dropped up at hotel, still a bit in...  Hotel: Location of hotel perfect. Got in  in time for dinner. Had some dinner at the restaurant- I had a great salad and pasta. And then get our stuff ready for a 3:30am wake up! Food was great and diverse, plus cheaper wine than in Belize! Hotel room was just okay. But we were just"
40,"I stayed in a tent on a platform at the Jaguar Inn. I appreciate that this hotel had this option, as accommodation can be expensive in Tikal. The wifi was almost non-existent, and the restaurant overpriced. The staff was helpful, the grounds beautiful and you can't beat the location."
50,"Definitely a MUST if you are ever in Peten, Guatemala!   It is worth the trip from Guatemala city! It has an amazing view from the top, you can watch the sunrise/sunset. I recommend to stay in Flores, which is closeby, because it is a beautiful town too."
30,We stayed at the huge quadruple tent. It was equipped with mattresses and sleeping bags but it was placed in an odd place with 2 other tents next to each other. We've found the staff somehow bored and seemed to have a constant inflow of turists therefore without a need to be customer service oriented. But it was worth of stay due to location. We had our food as well in local food stalls located in front of hotel and these offered far better experience. 
50,"To clarify, we stayed at the hostal site of the lodge. The 12 rooms and shared restrooms are the former site of the original archaeologists quarters. They have been renovated nicely and the stairs literally lead directly into Tikal National Park. The rooms are basic, nothing fancy, but quiet. You are lured to sleep by sounds of the rainforest. Even though it was a shared style space, everybody was extremely respectful and tired from long days of exploring.   We booked the sunrise tour with Tony. Due to the weather, it ended up as a fogrise, but that is out of anybody's control. The staff wakes you up on the morning of your tours, provides you coffee and a boxed breakfast, and off you go. Tony is a local character having lived in the area for over 50 years (since he was 5 years"
30,"Location is very handy for the Tikal Mayan site, and the cabins are amongst trees with many birds and an incredible group of spider monkeys. Great for photos. Unfortunately I think the restaurant had an off day while we were there - options unavailable (which is understandable) but restaurant staff somewhat unfriendly (which is not, had something upset them?)  But all-in-all I'd visit again, great experience."
50,"This hotel is absolute the best place to stay when visiting Tikal and offers easy walking access to the park.   Beautiful cabins tucked back into the jungle beautifully landscaped and maintained .   Be prepared to hear the jungle animals during the night.   When was the last time you heard howler monkeys in the trees at night  outside your room ?  In the morning, we were treated to a troop of spider monkeys swinging thru the trees.   I had breakfast and dinner in the hotel restaurant and they were the best meals I had in two weeks in Guatemala.   In the last week of January 2019,  the hotel appeared to be only about 1/2 occupied.   If you book with the hotel,  they can arrange shuttle service from the Petan airport directly to the hotel entrance ( it's 60 Kilometers).  Do this,"
50,This is a very nice hotel and more than deserves its 3 stars the food and drinks are a little more expensive than in other parts of Guatemala but thAt is to be expected in the middle of the jungle .. the noises of a night are fabulous from the howler monkeys .. writing this round the pool where the WiFi works well
40,"We just had two nights here as we wanted to have a full day exploring the Mayan ruins. It's right at the entrance to the site. Rooms are comfortable enough and sleep came easily. Each is a standalone cabin surrounded by trees and gardens. Consequently there are plenty of wildlife spotting opportunities right outside your door. We had Howler and Spider Monkey's passing right over our roof as well as Toucans, Parrots and the odd Agouti. Likewise the walk into the Archeological site was teeming with birds and other creatures. Reception was efficient and helpful and the restaurant served good if slightly expensive food. The bar area was generally quiet and again the staff were friendly and helpful. If you are visiting Tikal National Park, staying here will save you a half hour round"
30,"The setting:  You are about an hour from Flores airport by car, inside Tikal National Park.  We chose this place because it seemed the nicest of the three hotels inside the park.  We were taking the sunrise tour of Tikal and wanted proximity to the archeological sites as well as to be able to wake up at 3am, instead of 1:30-2am, if we stayed in Flores.  There is a large reception area here with plenty of seating.  You pay for your room upon arrival, not upon departure.  Leave a credit card authorization if you want to charge food to your room.  We arrived at around 10pm, and the restaurant was closed.  Make sure you grab some food in Flores if you are arriving on the late evening flight, as eating at the hotel will not be possible.  As we checked in, we were told that"
30,"The only reason to come here is to be close to the amazing Tikal Park. Not the worst place to stay, but not great either, especially for the price. Service and food are just ok, not great. Rooms are very basic, gets pretty hot without a fan when the power goes out at 9:00 pm. Shower was bordering on gross. Pool and setting is nice though."
30,"Situated within walking distance of Tikal, this hotel is in an ideal location. The rooms were ok, but nothing spacial but the gardens and pool were lovely. There were many different bird species seen in the gardens throughout the day. The breakfast was OK but the evening meal was disappointing and the meat was of poor quality"
50,"We stayed here for 3 nights in February. We enjoyed the food and found the service to be excellent. We had a guided tour of the park with Elias whom I would highly recommend.  He was incredibly knowledgeable and was able to answer all our questions about the area's history, geography and flora and fauna. His English is excellent. Ask for him at the front desk!!"
30,"Firstly the positives - being woken by howler monkeys who sounded as if they were in our bungalow, watching a troop of spider monkeys moving through the trees in the grounds, also seeing parrots, vultures, turkeys, capybaras, and much more. I doubt that we would have seen so much had we chosen to stay in the main hotel, but our bungalows were a couple of minutes walk away into the bush. The bungalow itself was ok, the pool was a welcome relief, and the staff were friendly, if a little disorganised sometimes. And of course the hotel is situated 2 minutes walk from the gates of the park, so you can get in earlier, or stay later, than the busloads who come in from Flores, allowing you to see the ruins, and the wildlife, in peace. When we climbed temple IV late in the afternoon"
40,"Jungle Lodge is comprised of small duplex bungalows that are a decent size, and each has a small front porch with two chairs. The bathroom was quite large, and had all the amenities, the only quibble being that the hot water was barely hot and the water pressure not great. Breakfast was included and was quite good, dinners were average. There is a lobby area with decent wifi and a bar area that served pretty good caiparinhas. The grounds are quite pretty - partially tamed jungle with stone walkways to take you to the cabins or the main recpetion lodge. They were quite slippery in the rain. The best thing about Jungle Lodge is its proximity to the entrance to the Tikal monuments - about 300 metres! There is a pool area that looked quite nice but we didn't use it as the weather"
40,"Jungle Lodge has two kinds of rooms: a simpler one (hostel) with shared bathrooms and suites spread out in smaller buildings all over the property. As it is, I tried both. My first night was spent in the hostel wing. The room was comfortable, the shared bathrooms well equipped and all was well except that the wing is very close to the common area (restaurant, bar, living area, wi-fi) and there was a group of very noisy young people there. I couldn't sleep, even though the generators that night went off at 11pm. The next morning, I was up at sunrise to explore the environs. Needless to say, in total zombie mode.  After breakfast, I asked reception for a change of rooms, to something farther away from the common area. In other words, an upgrade. There was some talking over the"
40,This is a nice hotel- not overtly high end- but a great location and clean and tidy right in the national park. It allowed us to visit the ruins a number of times. My children also enjoyed monkey and bird spotting as they swam in the pool. We ate in the resturant for two nights and got good quality food and service. We would return.
50,People's from maati jungle very polite serving promptly .Food is very nice and delilight.service is a exilent. Property is very  easy and clean. Mr.b k mishra is good and helping nature. We enjoyed a lot. Thanks to maati jungle lodge team Best of luck Thanking you  Regards Dr.shivaji MUNDE  Dr. ANJALI munde
30,"Superbly located to see the sunrise over the ruins. The cabins are comfortable, but a bit too minimalistic (shower not really hot etc). The pool was very green and not suitable for use. Food in the restaurant is OK - with the exception of the chocolate deserts these were amazing Service at the desk and restaurant is a bit chaotic. A lot of the staff seemed to be in training, trying hard but clearly still in the learning stage which results in mix ups etc "
40,"1) Location. Location. Location. It is the closest accommodations to the park entrance. If you are doing the sunrise tour at 4 am you want to start out as close as you can be to the park entrance.  2) Electricity 24/7! Yes! 24/7! It's the jungle. After you shower and dry off you will break into a sweat again. (Bring Talcum powder!)Thank goodness our ceiling fan was on after showering. We had room 10- only room with a king bed. Wifi only at the cafe/restaurant. We were ok with this. It's comfortable there and forced us to be social. Hot water was available at only certain times. Being that this was the jungle, it was not an issue.  3) Food was not bad at all. Their typical Guatemalan breakfast good as well as the pancakes. Chicken panini was so good at lunch I also had it for"
20,"Jaguar Inn has a campsite on their ground where tent and bedding are provided for around $30 per night. It's a small covered platform next to a bathroom (with shower) where they cramp 4-5 tents smack against each other. In the rainy season it's wet and muddy. Sometimes the shower has no water, other times just cold water. The showers are not clean or maintained. The public campsite in the park is much better, and cheaper (bring your own tent, bedding)."
40,"We rented a  tent for 120Q. It had matrasses and a clamp sleepingbag. Its easy if you want tot see the Sunrise in tikal. We aranged a guided tour + transport in flores for the day before for 120Q and 150Q entrance fee pp, wich was worth it becaus you het to learn more of the history and the nature. The morning after we left at 4am to watch the Sunrise. You pay the 100Q pp en trance fee wich alows you in untill 8am. Time enough for the Sunrise and doing the less populair sites. So you can pritty much see everithing."
40,"We arrived after 3pm so were able to use the same ticket for that evening and the next day. You are paying for the convenience of Tikal here after all, not the hotel which would elsewhere in Guatemala seem overpriced. Room were good sized and had two full size beds and a futon so were fine for two adults and a child. Room and bathroom were clean but basic. Hot water was great. The ceiling fans in the room were industrial so easily kept the room cool but at night were not needed as it cooled down alot with the screened windows open. Reception and restaurant staff were very nice and the food was good, if expensive for Guatemala. Most of the rooms are 2 rooms in a shared bungalow so bring a noisemaker if you don't plan on doing the sunrise tour because your neighbours will probably"
30,"My team (four people) spent a night at the Jaguar Inn at the end of November. The good:  1. It's in the park! 2. Pretty cool layout & architecture.  3. Full restaurant (food was probably a 6.5 out of 10 - not bad and worth the price). 4. More/less comfortable rooms.  5. Friendly staff.  6. Good price.  7. The sunrise tour is pretty epic, even if it is during a massive downpour. I would probably recommend staying for a hike during the day if it's raining during sunrise. We left right afterwards and regretted it.   Other things to note:  1. Our room did have a small leak. Not a big deal, but there were drips coming in due to the torrential rain.  2. Our guide, Caesar, was very friendly, perfect English, and knowledgeable. He was also a bit unorthodox and a little more wide ranging"
20,"Our experience of this hotel likely would have been much better if we had stayed in one of the bungalows.  Instead we were in one of the rooms in the main building, right next to the lobby and restaurant.  The way the roof/ceiling is constructed carries all of the noise from the lobby and restaurant into the rooms.  And I mean all.  The only thing that saved us from being awake late into the nite is that they turn off the electric power at about 10 pm, so people finally leave the restaurant.  But at 4 am we were awakened both days by people gathering in the lobby to catch tour buses.  We could hear everything they said as if we were in the same room.  Front desk staff were friendly and helpful, but the wait staff in the restaurant were surly.   Meals were mediocre.  Electric"
40,"We arrived about 14.45 which just gave us time to check in to our room, which was lovely, but a surprisingly long way from the main hotel, it was nice to feel so remote, and to use the pool before our park ticket for tomorrow would let us in at 16.00 We didn't eat at the hotel as it was very expensive, though everywhere was, but are really pleased we stayed as it gave us the opputo make the most of the park"
40,"Hotel is nice, rooms minimal and upon checkin our reservation for a villa wasn't honored and we were given a 2nd floor, not what we had booked.  We were basically ""kicked out"" of our reservation because they had to accommodate a large group and gave our room away.  Electricity is minimal, 5:30 am to 8 am and 5:30 pm to 9 pm.  It's a rush to finish dinner and get back to the room to have a shower.  Bring a flashlight or iPhone app for the flashlight.  I understand jungle but have been in the Amazon and hotels ran on generators.  The restaurant was excellent, food good and wait staff nice and very helpful. Wifi is minimal and in lobby only restricted hours, not a problem but don't expect it. Location is good and close to park entry."
30,"Property is fine, with a nice pool and attentive, caring staff. The rooms are definitely not ""luxury"", but are fine for a few days at the ruins. We had a great day being guided around the ruins by Elias. He was informative about all aspects of Mayan history, culture, language, calendar - you name it. Be sure to ask for him."
40,"Part of an organized tour.  Hotel much better than expected.  Tranquil, light & airy, excellent food.  Rooms basic but comfy, mesh on windows so no bugs.  Expect it would be nice to hear the night-time insects/birds/animals but we were so pooped after the tour that sleep was never going to be a problem."
20,"This is a very convenient hotel to the Tikal Park. And the accommodations are adequate and clean. Our issue, however, is that when we arrived the front desk did not have a record of our reservation. We had reserved via Expedia ten months earlier. As it turned out (after a two-hour wait) they discovered that their Guatemala City office did, indeed, receive the reservation, but failed to enter it into the system. As a family of four adults, we had booked a suite; the best they could do was a room with two double beds. Fortunately, they did wedge a cot in eventually. One annoyance was no hot water our first evening; there was hot water day two. There is a pool, a restaurant and a bar - all are pleasant enough. But the failure to record our reservation and the inability to provide"
40,"The only bad part of my stay included the thin walls between rooms and the electricity turns off in the late afternoon. The lodge is located on the outskirts of Tikal national park and is in the middle of the jungle. So you get to wake up to the sounds of howler monkeys and tropical birds. Overall, the lodge has great rooms, food, amazing drinks, supportive staff and a real jungle experience."
30,"Location: excellent, right by the Mayan ruins in Tikal (you can walk to the park entrance in 4 mins) Rooms: Lovely rooms but thin walls between you and your neighbours. Nice, clean and modern bathrooms however sometimes the loo just wouldn’t flush (wouldn’t flush down just water) but in 30mins it would. Would’ve liked a desk in my room instead I got a tree log. Pool: Hood sized and not too cold! I assume very refreshing when it’s warm. Electricity: Not good, the lights in my bathroom turned off after 10:00 until around 8:00 am (very annoying when it gets dark). Sometimes the main light didn’t work but we always had one plug socket working (bring a multi plug). Water: Also bad, I had a cold showers and sometimes it would be warm but never that hot. Another note about water is"
50,"The lodge is located in the middle of the jungle, inside the reserve and 2 steps from the Tikal ruins entrance.   The lodge is a first class hotel. Great rooms, food, amazing drinks, supportive staff and a real jungle experience. There’re howrley monkeys and parrots hanging around the rooms and you wake up together with the jungle.  The swimming pool area is also fantastic.   As a bonus, have a tour in Tikal with Tony, arranged by the hotel reception. He grew up in the ruins (as he father was part of the explorers) and he’s a great storyteller.   Couldn’t recommend more this place. "
40,"Visiting Tikal! Started my day 7:30 in Antigua. My flight to Flores/TAG was totally late and I ended up  Irrived around 2pm in Flores, there were no one to give any info on the airport regarding Tikal. Got the only local shuttle available to Flores, there an agency charged me 400 efetivo/local to take me privately to the hotel in Tikal. The Evening tour was leavig when I arrived around 4:30, I grab a sandwich at the hotel- horrible, and join the tour! The hotel tour cost $25 but what a great tour, Jose Moreno pechemoreno1848@gmail.com, free lancer stayed with us behind, when everyone was gone the whole park was ours! It felt pretty special! In general the hotel was fine, shared baths, location is great, food had high and lows, staff was good! The location is great for early and"
40,"Ideal location to walk the grounds of Tikal. The room was minimal but did its purpose. We enjoyed the restaraunt. Electricity is what it is because you are in a remote location. We were bit by bugs in the room, yet that is to be expected being in the jungle."
30,"I realize we were in a reserve with limited power which I understand, but there was some other disturbing aspects of this stay. Maybe its the lack of communication between staff and guest, but you were always wondering what was going on. Our tour guide was late and when he showed up, there was no announcement he just waited out front. Prior to that there was lots of vans coming and going, people everywhere and I had to keep asking ""are you are guide"" Then when power comes on at 6:00, my husband tried to take a shower at 6:30 and it was cold. When I asked about it he said they had to replace something and it would be on in a few minutes. 30 minutes later I had a cold shower, then no water at all. The wait staff rarely smiled or greeted you. My husband would go out of his way to"
50,Tikal is a very very large place. A few hours just doesn't do it justice. Stay for the night and do it in two days (two entrance fees {ouch}) It is true that the generators cut out post nine.... and it gets awfully dark. Bring a flashlight to avoid stumbling into something on the way back from the restroom. Check out the tree by the pool around sunset. There are monkeys in the trees across from the cabins.  The front end staff deserves note.... Julio y Roxy were great to us!   This is a jungle and they play the motif tastefully. It is not something Johnny Weismuller would fit in.  The food was really good as well.
40,"We stayed in the bungalows that were pool side, and it was absolutely perfect for what we wanted to do: explore Tikal. Tikal is so big that just doing a day tour would have felt insufficient. Even more so, because we were there for two nights - we had the opportunity to explore the park during off-peak hours where it wasn't too crowded.   We checked in around dinner time. As many others have mentioned, electricity, internet and hot water are limited to morning hours and evening hours - but that was perfect for us and we were not inconvenienced. Internet was spotty in the lobby, but we didn't go to Guatemala to stay plugged in so it was not an issue for us at all.   The staff were very helpful throughout our stay. We organized a sunrise tour, and I would definitely recommend it"
50,"I stayed in a Ranchon room, which was very good sized, and had a nice large bathroom,  It was about a 5 minute walk through the jungle from the main hotel area, and at night after the generator was off, it was a bit exciting.  Bring a flashlight!  The food in the restaurant was excellent, the pool was lovely, the property is about a 5 minute walk from the entrance to the ruins, and the Sunset Tour that was included was outstanding!  The hotel also accommodated my very early morning departure by providing my breakfast ahead of time."
40,"We were visiting Tikal and wanted to shorten our wait for the shuttle to Flores. We had a smoothie each and went out just before our shuttle (last of the day) was supposed to leave. It wasn't there... We went back to Jaguar inn and thanks to their helpful staff made the contact with bus agency and fugured our way out. Thanks for helping to solve problem that was not their... Apart from that the smoothie (well and the rest of the menu) was a little pricy, but everything clean, friendly staff, nice experience."
30,"The hotel is well situated next to the main entrance of Tikal. Staff are helpful and friendly, rooms are clean and nets keep the mosquitoes out. It's basic, but has what you need for a night in the jungle.  Best advice is to arrive in the afternoon, spend the night and visit the park early the next morning. The park opens at 6 am, but hotel guests can be let in earlier. Bring a thermos with coffee and enjoy."
40,"Great spot and excellent rooms, would recommend a tour from one of the guides at the park. It is a great place to visit in Guatamala. Food and drinks were also good at the hotel. Would recommend a trip to Flores which is about 5$us in a taxi from there. We spent one night and that was enough to visit the park the evening before for sunset and then in the morning before we left. "
30,Room was comfortable (but beds were small).  Hearing the monkeys and birds and other animal outside of your bungalow at night was nice.  The free wifi the hotel offered to guests did not work in the rooms and did not work consistently even in the restaurant/lobby.  The hammocks placed outside of bungalows/rooms should just be taken down as they are not even usable.  The hotel staff seemed bothered to be asked a question or to do anything.  The one exception was Ceasar the park guide.  He was Excellent!
50,"First, remember that you are staying in a hotel in the jungle. It cannot be the Ritz. Service was excellent, Water and ice in restaurant are pure. They will fill your water bottle gratis. Room was just fine. Location perfect. Hot water is sporadic (remember point #1). WIFI good. Food decent. Highly recommended"
40,"My wife and I stayed there for a couple of days  - Excellent location, right next to the Tikal National Park entrance - Clean and well-decorated rooms - Clean and comfortable beds - Not all staff are friendly; there are some rude ones  - Food is costly and not very tasty  - It's so far away from everything, yet they don't provide drinking water. They are taking advantage of guests who had to buy everything from the hotel - Wifi is slow (as expected) and only works in the reception area - The pool table is lovely. Also, the swimming pool is excellent too - Perfect wake up call at 5.30am by Howler Monkeys  - Electricity timings are very limited. But, the fan and one power point is always on - Hot water is not provided at all the times"
50,"The Jungle Lodge Hotel at Tikal is truly a magical experience! Right next to Tikal Mayan Ruins, and in the Guatemalan jungle, this lodge is one of a kind! The staff are very friendly and accommodating, the individual lodges are very nice & up to date, and the restaurant is delicious. This was a once in a lifetime experience that will never be forgotten! "
50,"The Jungle Lodge Hotel is pretty much everything it promises to be - you stay here for the unbeatable proximity to Tikal.   I stayed two nights, each in a different room, which were both really nice. Note that there’s no AC but there is a fan that runs during the electricity hours that does the job. It’s also not too hot given you’re in the jungle. Honestly you’d be hard pressed to find nicer accommodation in Flores which is where most visitors to the park stay.  The highlight of my stay was the sunrise tour with Tony, who seems to be a bit of a Tikal institution. I don’t think I’ve had a more knowledgeable guide in my travels through Central America, and he’s also a really colourful character with a dry sense of humour. There were only five people in my morning tour group so we"
50,The Jungle Lodge was an absolute treat for a family with four kids. We were the first Tanzanians to stay at the lodge since it was built. We stayed in 2 different rooms being a family of 6 and we cannot say enough about the cleanliness of the rooms. It was such a treat to be in such close proximity with Tikal. Our girls enjoyed being right in the middle of nature and the swimming pool was a treat for them.
40,"We stayed 3 nights in 3 different rooms so saw all but the most plush of the accommodation! All rooms were very clean with comfy beds. Only niggle was having to pay for breakfast but the tipico breakfast was large and filling. For lunch we ate at the local comedors. Restaurant had only pasta for us vegetarians which was a shame but the food was fresh and tasty. Excellent cocktails. Didn't use the pool, the shuttle service or their guides as had booked this with Marlon from Gem Trips (highly recommended). Great location, friendly restaurant staff and a chilled place right in Tikal. Saw so much wildlife which was a bonus; toucans,spider&howler monkeys, wild turkeys & coati's!!"
50,"We loved our visit. The assistant manager was very knowledgeable about the ruins and helped us with an excellent guide as well as with a 4AM hike. Be realistic: The hotel is in the jungle in a national park so don't expect 24/7 electricity or hot water. It's clean and safe and very nice. The pool was very refreshing. The food is fresh, some from their own garden. We have enjoyed both visits there (June and October, 2016). We will definitely return!"
40,"Well maintaned property, beds are not bad.  Electricity is limited from 0600 - 0800 a.m., 6:00 - 8:00 p.m.  Hot water during these hours, an emergency lamp in each room for off-hours.  Pool could have been cleaner, is only hotel with pool.  Good restaraunt on location, very tasty food.  Service is excellent.  Definitely no bugs.  Staying in the park is great.  Bring books or cards, we stayed two nights without either, would've been nice to have them."
30,"This hotel is pretty average, but its location is not. You simply have to stay in the national park if you really want to enjoy Tikal to the full. We stayed in the cheapest rooms at the bottom of the sawdust path in the forest. We were very satisfied with our room. It was large, a bit basic but frankly adequate for what we needed. We did see more wildlife as we walked to and from our room. The pool is small and ok for a quick dip, but not really our thing. Children would appreciate it. The grounds are teaming with birds, colourful toucans love the berries in the palms near the pool. The montezuma oropendola all roost in the big trees in the evening and you can hear them making their distinctive call and display. The food however, was disappointing and a bit pricey. Don't be"
30,"We stayed in Hotel Tikal Inn as part of a 2 day tour to the Tikal National Park. The hotel is very basic but that was not a problem (we expected this) and it was VERY clean. Also, I have to say that the food was really good!  Just a few things to note and be prepared for: this hotel is one of two that are located directly in the national park. There are a few market stalls, 3 museums and i think a restaurant apart from the two hotels - nothing else. Make sure you bring sufficient cash as there is no ATM and places will not accept credit cards. Also, warm water and electricity is only available for a few hours in the morning and in the evening. This means lights out at 9:30 - 10:00 and requires careful planning for showering / charging electronics. The wifi is only available in"
50,"We had the great pleasure of staying at the Hotel Tikal Inn during a recent trip to Tikal. There are very few accommodations in the national park. We visited them all and it is the best. Service, individual clean spacious cabins and a pool make this place special. Goods guides are available for the archaeological site."
50,"Really enjoyed our stay, the staff were helpful and friendly, and the room was clean and spacious . The hotel has a fantastic location right in the park and you can sit outside in the early morning or evening in the lovely outside dining area and listen to the noise of the howler monkeys ! Only issue to bear in mind is lack of mobile phone reception in this area and also the Internet was not working on our first day although was fixed by the following day."
30,"Firstly the good: I was pleasantly surprised by my room: the linens were clean and smelt clean, the bathroom was also, and there was everything you want in a hotel room: hangers, a desk you can place things, a bedside table and lamp and space to place things around the bathroom sink. Also good was the tour guide Jose, who is a freelance guide: genuinely knowledgable and funny. We saw lots of animals and learnt a lot about Tikal on his sunrise tour  The bad: the Fawlty towers start-watching incompetent staff faff about and finding my room hadn't been cleaned yet, even though it was after 2pm. The funny thing was Cesar was embarrassed and talked to the reception staff about it and they didn't seem to care. Cesar is the in-house guide. There were quite a few questions he deflected."
30,"Great location in the park. Open late. Friendly manager. Staff can be trained to provide better service. Rooms are spacious, cleanliness is acceptable given the location, clean linen. The one thing I would absolutely change about our reservation is to take only the room and not the package. Do NOT opt for the hotel packages that include meals and tours! Please find a local tour guide based on online or guidebook recommendations and use the local restaurants for your dining options."
50,"We stayed in the Jaguar Inn for our trip to see the magnificent Mayan ruins at Tikal. They organised our transfer from our hotel in San Ignacio in Belize for us. The border crossing was easy and efficient. One Belizean driver and taxi brought us to the border. We were then picked up by a Guatemalan taxi and driver to bring us to Tikal. It was a weekday mid morning when we were at the border and the transfer took no more than 10 minutes. We had to pay to exit Belize and then to enter Guatemala (USD7). When returning the next day we were dropped at the Guatemalan border by out Guatemalan driver and then met on the other side by the Belizean driver.  We did the sunrise tour with the guide from the hotel (Jose Louis). He was an excellent, knowledgeable guide who really brought Tikal"
10,"This place is one of the worst places ive ever stayed at... and i travel quite a bit. It bothered me so much i took the time out to write a review. the wifi connection goes in and out all day long. the hotel itself closes the main area at 9pm so no more electricity, no AC, no wifi, not fans, no water. nothing. the place is swealtering hot all the time. we stayed in tents outside bc we originally thought it would be a neat idea. but viewed the hotel rooms to see if we wanted to change our minds and stay in there- they were shabby and run down. so we opted for the tents anyway. the showers were slimy and mildewy. and there was a rancid sewage smell coming from the drain pipes that emanated throughout the camp site that was almost unbearable! we complained to the management, they"
50,"Beautiful lodge literally in the middle of nowhere.  My family and stayed here one night and I was taken back in time.  This lodge offers everything that nature can possible offer.  The setting is very amazing.  The lodges are very clean, the staff are very friendly and the food is authentic Guatemalan.  One feel likes one is truly living in the rainforest. One thing I feel that they can offer are lanterns in each lodge for when the power goes out at night and filtered water in the main lodge for guests to fill up their water bottles.  The location is perfect seeing that it is right outside the park. Thank you we truly enjoyed our stay and would recommend it anyone headed that way."
40,My friends and I stayed here for one night because we did an overnight hike of Tikal. The location was perfect - you are literally right in the jungle. Howler monkeys were right above us at night and we felt part of the wildlife. Breakfast and dinner were delicious and very filling. Shout out to Marco who always served us and was a gem - so sweet and humored my terribly spoken Spanish. This is a place to unplug and be one with nature.
30,"The rooms were lovely, even got an upgrade.  Generator goes off from 10-6 and during off hours, but ceiling fan and one outlet work 24/7.  Showers are heated by solar so plan accordingly. Nice beds and porches.  Small relaxing pool.  Pool table in lodge was fun. Bar and restaurant and front desk service was horrible and pricey for below average food. Wifi in the lodge worked but slowly. All in all the way to go to the park, but don't expect first rate dining or decent service, esp if big tour groups are there.    Note: you must pay to enter the park at the bank at the entrance - 20 mins form the hotel. The info on the website about using an after 3pm ticket the next day is incorrect. Prices for foreigners are way higher than locals.  Kids under 12 are still free."
50,"The basic rooms feel luxurious in this setting, staying in the Bunyan’s listening to the howler monkeys beats listening to traffic and dogs bark in the rest of Guatemala! Take the extended sunrise tour which covers most of the site and a take away breakfast is included. Our tour guide was Jose who was an excellent and knowledgeable guide-he was enthusiastic and didn’t just show us the ruins but also the trees, birds and monkeys and his English was excellent which helps in this kind of historic tour. The staff at the hotel were very helpful and assist with any service needed-they arranged a reasonable priced shuttle from Flores airport and back to Flores. The pool and happy hour is great to cool down after trekking through the jungle. The restaurant is a little pricey but to be"
50,"We had an amazing stay at the Jungle Lodge. The staff was extremely friendly! This is a jungle experiance, but the ceiling fans stayed on all night and kept the room reasonable. Breakfast after our sunrise tour in the park was delicious!"
50,The Inn is basic and clean and the staff is excellent.  Roxy Ortiz is a wealth of information and we appreciated her insight and experience.  We met a couple who had been a week in Costa Rica hiking wildlife trails.  They said they saw more wildlife in one morning at the Inn than they had their entire stay in Coast Rica.
40,"Overall I liked this hotel.  It's in a fabulous location and being somewhat remote the unreliable wifi and the limited electricity did not bother me.  They have emergency lighting in your room for those times you need it.  The rooms are clean and the beds are comfortable.  I didn't use the pool but the layout is attractive.  My only gripe is the ""packages"" they sell.  A combination tour with a breakfast and dinner voucher.  First it was not explained that these vouchers were only good for a limited menu.  Second they could only be applied to breakfast the day after the tour, not the day of the tour. This left me with a bad taste in my mouth as instead of applying it toward a real breakfast it went against an American cheese on white bread sandwich which I didn't want as I caught"
50,"I spent 2 nights at the Tikal Inn mid- November. I was part of a group of family and friends celebrating my birthday and the November full-moon. I enjoyed my spacious bungalow, the food, the pool in the heat of the day and most especially the 3 hours that we all spent touring Tikal with local resident archaeologist, Nancy Ortiz. I spent 7 weeks in Guatemala and this may have been my favorite 3 hours. She brought the history, the flora, fauna and spirit of Tikal completely alive. She is an amazing guide - articulate, engaging and inspiring. Don't miss the opportunity if you are lucky enough to have it. As for spiders and insects, yes we saw them. Like the birds  the monkeys and the Mayans, they live there."
10,"It is basic, which we were expecting - and it was totally fine   We were however also expecting electricity and food - and not expecting cockroaches, though wild-life was advertised as a feature!!!  The electricity was only on in the rooms from 6:00-8:00 in the morning and 6:30-9:30 in the evening ... so no lights, fans, power for phones, wifi, or hot water outside of those times  Even worse - the morning slot overlaps with the Sunrise tour to park - so you don't even get to use the morning slot  Regarding the food - the menu was basic, and the food served was good ... but we there was really no choice, and nothing for dessert - when asked we were advised to buy a popsicle from the store  Look - it was one night - we made it work, and did not let it spoil our fantastic"
40,"Tikal Inn is right in the middle of the park: quiet, clean yet easily accessible. It is immaculate and maintained well and hosts an onsite archeologist; Roxana Maria who goes by the name of Roxy.  Clearly her technical expertise and managerial talent have endeared her to the staff giving her a loyal following. The staff go out of their way to cater to your needs. With some mild encouragement in imagination from Roxy they created the most delectable off menu vegetarian meals for us. The food at Tikal Inn cannot be described as modest and for a place so cut off that is saying a lot. If you are going to stay in the park, no matter what Inn you pick, just remember these oddities: 1. Prepare to be scared out of your body at night by screeching monkeys 2. Even the mildest of moisture"
50,"I should start by saying that by the time I got to Tikal I had already been travelling for over 6 weeks, the last 2 of which were spent on a reef conservation project in Belize and that by that time I have not had a hot shower in a very very long time. To me, the Jaguar Inn in Tikal was sheer luxury! I splashed out a bit as it was out of season and they were offering a discount, so I got a private room (in a bungalow) with a queen bed. No complaints whatsoever! The bed was big and comfortable, the bedlinen clean, the room spacious and equipped with aircon (though I did not use it as it was a bit chilly and rainy) and the bathroom was  the best bathroom I had seen for at least a month. Yes, perhaps my expectations were low and therefore they were exceeded, but I genuinely think"
50,"Hotel is very comfortable with beautiful landscaping.  Staff are very friendly, welcoming, and accomodating. Food was very good and coffee was excellent.  It's adjacent to the Tikal complex and about 20 minutes walk to the Jaguar Temple."
40,"We arrived up at Tikal 'village' at about 4.30pm. We initially tried the camping/hammock option based behind the research centre but that was all booked out (we didn't have a tent).  So Jaguar Inn was our second option, and because of the rain, I think it suited us better.  The cost was $110 a person, so very steep (research place was $70pp) but we wanted the sunrise so knew it would cost.  The tents were very close proximity so that they could all fit under a shelter. While this meant not much privacy, when it rained numerous times during the night, it was greatly appreciated.  Because of the rain, this also meant the restaurant and proximity of the toilets/showers was great.  If rain hadn't been an issue, then the research centre would have been fine."
30,We spend one night a the hotel. The rooms are big but quit basis. The wifi worked extremely bad.  When I emailed the hotel regarding the booking the service was excellent with quick replay all the time. Unfortunately the service at the hotel was not the same and they didn't seems to pay much interest in their guests.  The food is good but pricy. 109 as for dinner and 60 as for breakfast.  We booked a sunrise tour though the hotel. The guide was very good. And even though it was too fuggy to se the sunrise it was a very nice tours
50,"I loved my stay here. I had a difficult time deciding between the 3 hotels in the park. I went with this one because they had a price special going that included a single room, breakfast and a tour for $75. IT was well worth it! The room was BEAUTIFUL with a hammock outside overlooking the garden. And they brought a portable airconditioner in before I arrived to get the place really cool which was nice. The pancakes for breakfast were yummy. I did the sunrise tour...it was wonderful! Well worth it. You can do the tour cheaper from Flores, but what I liked about doing it from here was that we were ahead of all the other tour groups, so it was super quiet when we entered. It was a really special experience. And the staff at the Jaguar Inn are beyond helpful and friendly. The best"
30,"My son and I spent two nights at Tikal Inn to access Tikal Parque for a full day including early morning and evening entries. We also took advantage of their meal and ""tour"" package for the day and next morning.. We stayed in the far end room (rustic with minimum times for electricity) down a long path and did not take advantage of the pool. Meals were acceptable. We did get our 4:00 a.m. wake-up call."
30,"If you want to visit the extensive Mayan archaeological site at Tikal, this hotel is located inside the park itself and is just a short walk from the entrance to the site.  However, if you want creature comforts, perhaps not the best place to stay.  Electricity is only available for a short time in the morning and evening so if you want all the amenities and ""cons"", stay in Flores, 60 kms south. Food is quite good and there is a pool which is a boon especially after trekking around the ruins which are best visited in the early morning before the heat of the day sets in.  Warning:  bring a torch/flashlight.  Listen for the howler monkeys at night."
40,Excellent location right in the national park. To get a good jungle experience some sacrifices need to be made. The rooms are designed with screen walls and shutters to keep insects out but allow noise in. This allows you to lie in bed and hear the jungle come alive (the wildlife can get very noisy). Electricity is only available at set periods in morning and evening which can make the rooms sticky at night and no variety of pillows made for poor sleep. On the plus side avoids light pollution.  Stayed here for 2 nights.
40,"We spent a few days at the Hotel Tikal Inn and it was quite enjoyable. First, this place is adjacent to the Tikal park, a five-minute walk to the entrance. It is in the JUNGLE, so yes, there will be spiders, humidity, and electricity and wifi only a few hours a day. This is not a Hilton in the jungle, it's better! Our room was quite clean and offered everything we needed, including a really hot shower. The pool and garden area were likewise very well-maintained and were welcome respite after hiking around the jungle. Staff were uniformly friendly and helpful. Food and drink were of average quality and priced a bit on the high side, however, all of it has to be transported many miles so the prices make sense. The only down side was that as independent travellers, we had to put up"
30,"The location was the best thing about Tikal Inn, just minutes away from the ruins. The swimming pool was not of a very engaging colour, and the rooms themselves were quite basic. Small animals and insects could get in through the bathroom, and there was no electricity at night. Could be way better if refurbished."
50,"This travel lodge was founded in 1956 by Mr Antonio Ortiz who led the expeditioners from University of Pennsylvania  that uncovered the lost city of Tikal.  The hotel has been in the family for 3 generations now, and the new generation  has done a great job at building a new facilty that perfectly blends in with the jungle setting.  There are two sets of rooms in the hotel.  One part are the rooms originally used by the archaeologists who have been refurbished and these share excellent bathroom facilities with other rooms.  The other sets of rooms are bungalows exquisitely   appointed   , with jacuzzi, outdoor shower, indoor shower bathtub  for a blissful jungle experience .  The lodge is right next to the park entrance and has a super swimming pool, great for refreshing after a"
50,"This place is so well located, you're literally right next to the park entrance. The staff are also extremely accommodating. The day I arrived, I had an onset of food poisoning from the previous night. We had already paid for the tour but they let me use the funds for food the next day. We arrived at 9 AM so our room wasnt ready, but the staff let me lay down in the lobby and were very attentive. As soon as my room was ready, the staff took my stuff to my room and let me sleep. My tour guide brought me tea at some point and it helped my stomach SO much. They continued to provide me tea all weekend and it was never charged to the room.   The guides are extremely knowledgeable. I had Vinnie and Tony. Vinnie escorted us from the airport to the hotel and was my tour guide the day I"
50,Amazing place to stay. Its right beside the entrance of the park so it's really close. The sunrise tour begins with coffee surrounded by tiki torches and the coffee is amazing. The food in the restaurant is also really good. Had the best 2 guides ever on a trip. Both of them knew so much about Tikal and the history of the place but also had very different knowledge to bring
50,"We stayed for 2 nights and were treated to a troop of howler monkeys at around 3am each night - this is not a complaint - it's awesome! The locally provided guide was knowledgeable and easy to talk to, speaking very good English.  The lodge facilities were great and food very good. Slightest issue was one of the front desk staff not brilliant at English, but probably the fault is ours for not having good enough Spanish! You need to be prepared for the electricity being cut for a number of hours, but the fan still works and we had no issues."
40,"Ample sized rooms, clean and located 10 minute walk from the park.  This is the place to stay if you want the 4:00am start.  Our guide, Tony, was knowledgeable, easy to understand, and very much a part of the community.  The electricity goes off at 9:30, with the fan continuing to run.  The hot water is spotty."
40,"Location, location, location! And excellent service with outstanding local knowledge and warm hospitality from Alex - you made my stay fantastic! So great to have the Guatemalan jungle at your doorstep with all the amenities - including good food, great wine and Flores just a car ride away. The place to be for sunrise and sunset views of this ancient site. And just plain hanging out there at any time listening to the howler monkeys. Take my advice - speak to Alex and Caesar before planning your activities."
50,"We arrived at the Jaguar Inn after a long flight from the U.S., and even longer bus ride from Guatemala City.  We were tired, frazzled, and in bad need of a shower.  We arrived at the Jaguar Inn around 11 am, hoping for an early check-in.  The concierge, Alejandro (who speaks perfect English) was happy to oblige.  After a brief break and wonderful shower, it was a short walk to the amazing ruins of Tikal.  The Jaguar Inn arranged a sunrise tour of the ruins for the next day.  Our guide, Caesar, was very knowledgeable and entertaining.  In addition to sharing the history of the site, he shared some of his own experiences of Guatemala.  Overall, we couldn't have been happier.  Although the Jaguar Inn is a bit more expensive than places in Flores, we would recommend the Jaguar Inn"
30,"I spent three nights at this hotel, have to say, in the middle of a jungle, one should be really grateful to someone who built and runs this place. It offers you a clean room, a cafeteria, hot water, and WiFi (only in cafeteria though). Staff are nice and responsive. A few things are good to know before your going: 1) the guy handling reservation is not at hotel. The number given to you in confirmation is not the HOTEL NUMBER! you won't be able to reach the hotel using this number, and this number is not 24/7 reachable. Try to get everything fixed, confirmed prior your arrival. We did not see guys outside of airport to pick us up and it was 8pm and tried to reach the hotel or the guy did reservation, no luck at all. It was quite bit annoying given amount of money you paid in"
50,"I went just for two night stay to spend a day in Tikal National Park. Alejandro and the rest of the staff were pretty welcoming and helped me with everything I needed. The hotel is located right at the entrance of the Path of Ruins to Tikal, and offers a great experience surrounded by nature.  The hotel restaurant is pretty good and accommodations are pretty great as well, there are options for all budgets ranging from renting tent spaces to staying at a bungalow.  I really recommend staying here because since you're staying right at the National Park you can do the Tikal sunrise Tour. Definite recommendation for anyone looking to enjoy the complete experience of Tikal."
40,"The hotel is located at the starting point of the path to the ruins. We arrived by car in the middle of the afternoon at the entrance of the park, which allowed us to obtain tickets valid up to the end of the day after.  Our room, located in a small 2-store buiding in a tropical garden, had a very simple appearance but provided us with the services we could expect. This building continues to get electrical power when the rest of the hotel facilities are affected by a load shedding. Internet connection is available in the restaurant area. We had a first visit to the site for the sunset and had also booked for the sunrise tour (wake-up at 3:30 am!). Great experience, with the ruins, of course, and the animals and plants!  The restaurant of the hotel is good, with gentle and"
40,"Stayed one night in a bungalow by the pool. The bungalow was very good: spacious, clean, firm mattress, mosquito netted windows. Nice big clean pool. Friendly staff. Good breakfast. Easy walk to park entrance and to other food options.   It's worth staying the night in Tikal. We arrived in the afternoon and wandered up to the ruins after most people had gone for the day...nice and peaceful. Then we went with a private guide after breakfast next morning so we could learn more about the history of the site etc. "
40,"We stayed one night at the Tikal Inn during our Tikal visit and were overall happy with the hotel.   Nice grounds (and nice pool, great to relax there in the sun after the visit of the ruins!), ok room and decent food.  We did a sunrise tour but it was unfortunately a bit cloudy so not very spectacular. Quite intriguing though to walk in the Tikal park in near-complete darkness with the guide - we heard a lot of movement in the bushes and trees and even saw (and smelled) a very poisonous snake - argh!  NB: they don't have power/ electricity (and therefore hot water) between certain times (I think it was between 9.30pm and 6am) so make sure you time your showers appropriately and don't expect to party it up at night! Bring a flashlight! No great wifi either, but functional."
40,"We had a great visit at the Tikal Inn.  The staff was superbly accommodating to us and the other visitors..  We were able to walk to the Tikal Mayan site and visited it both days.  We booked the combo tour and restaurant package.  The food was fine though the choices were limited and not so special.  The pool was fantastic; it was large and had jets which provided movement and sound.  If you take the dawn tour, make sure you shower upon return instead of eating breakfast or you will miss the hot water in the morning.  We had little other problems with the electrical hours.  Unfortunately the staff did not stop the boy who mowed the grass while guests were eating breakfast and sitting by the pool and we were not woken up as requested at the front desk.  My wife contracted"
20,"We went to Tikal for a Sunrise trip. The price for the hotel was okay, approx 90US$ per night. The service was very friendly and the hotel okay. Unfortunately they go crazy with prices on food and beverages. The dinner for 10US$ was okay with an appetizer, main and dessert but the drinks - our fault, we didn't ask for the prices - are unreal, they charged us 44GTQ (~6US$) for a local beer and 90GTQ!! (~12US$) for a 2cl shot of Ron Zacapa 23. The next morning we got a boxed breakfast to take to the tour for 10US$ - we've added a picture, it was seriously a joke. So if you decide to stay there, take your own food or buy at the park the next day. Directly at the temples the same local beer is 15GTQ (2 US$)."
40,"Is one of the three hotels inside the Tikal Park. Big rooms with confortable beds, where you can stay in peace and relax. Big swimming pool and good restaurant  A good place to stay to get Tikal's ruins from where you can go walking very easily"
30,"Arrived in the early afternoon to see the sunset in Tikal. Stayed for one night of the tents they rent out. Very comfy but wanted to wake up with the birds and monkeys but unfortunately woke up from the loud talking group who get up at 3.30 for the sunrise...Through it was raining very hard and because of that it was good the tents were placed under a roof close to shower and toilet building what was very clean. The service in the hotel was not very effective or friendly..Worst coffee I had in 5 months of traveling and payed Q18 for it!!!! Went for to other place..Also there should be a possibility to change Dollars..Not, asked in the evening and morning for it but they hadn't enough money to give me back from $20."
30,"My husband and I showed late in the day with no reservation and the hotel was able to accommodate us. First off if you know when you are going to stay - BOOK ONLINE. The price online was around $40USD but in person was $90USD. The garden is nice, the staff was friendly and we enjoyed the sunrise tour with Caesar. The room we stayed could have been a little more clean, and did not have toilet paper. The staff quickly provided the toilet paper, however for a one night stay I chose to ignore the dirty diaper in the trash can. I enjoyed the experience of staying in the jungle and hearing the animals. Don't expect this to be a luxury resort, but a decent hotel in an amazing setting and great staff!"
20,"I really expected this place to be great. I didn't choose it, it was part of a 2 day/1 night Tikal package. If it cost $30 a night that would be something, but it costs something like $90 per couple for what is a 2 star hotel. Yes, it is within the park, and it is nice to wake up to hear the sound of the animals in the morning. There is little electricity, poor wifi, hot water for 3 hours per day, when you are unlikely to be in the hotel, very expensive food, and the guy in charge was extremely unfriendly. At night there is no electricity and so no fan, and it is very hot in the room. This hotel rides on the fact it is in the national park, and makes no effort at all to provide a service. Icing on the cake is that we wanted to pay for our food with a credit card, and that was"
40,"Don't be misled by the bad reviews. This place is great -- within close proximity of the ruins, very helpful staff, clean rooms with 24-hour fans and lights, and very hot water in the bathrooms. The staff are really very nice and helpful, particularly Ivan, Carlos, Santos and David. The tour guide, Caesar, is very knowledge, helpful, and friendly -- not at all pushy like one or two of the other reviews indicated. When I was short of quetzales in the park, he happily loaned me Q. 100 without even a thought. All in all, a really great place which is a bargain at $75/night."
40,"We stayed one night at the Hotel Jaguar Inn in Tikal and it worked out wonderfully.  The bungalow room was tidy and comfortable.   There are limited hours for hot water and electricity, but the overhead lights and fans work at all hours. Beds and bathroom are just fine. Windows are screened, but it's in the jungle, so a few bugs are to be expected (there were ants by the doorway, but nothing of major concern). Pleasantly surprised to find few to no Mosquitos!  Location is prime, right in the park just steps from the kioskos and the inner ticket office (for sunrise/sunset ticketing). The restaurant is fine, the staff are all friendly and accommodating, and there is wifi in the restaurant and patio area.   The grounds here are well maintained. Overall, quite a pleasant stay."
50,"Had a fabulous time at the Jungle Lodge. You cannot be any closer to Tikal, and to sleep in the heart of the Peter jungle is amazing. Waking to the sound of howler monkeys and hundreds of exotic birds is paradise. Staff is really friendly and welcoming and food is excellent. Rooms are simple but lovely. Who needs fancy amenities when you are in such a spectacular place. Wake early and go into the park as the sun rises before most guests arrive. You have the park to yourself and it is amazing. Come back for a late breakfast, and head back for more."
50,"I'd read some reviews saying the accommodations at Tikal National Park were pretty basic so I was expecting some pretty standard 2-3 star accommodation. Jungle Lodge is not basic. It is a strong 4 star establishment. The villas are beautifully set out with modern bathrooms, big beds and mosquito nets over the beds. The restaurant and bar have a big selection, the pool is in a beautiful setting and you are surrounded by the jungle. We stayed the one night, had a swim and a feed and up early for the dawn tour with Gem Trips (also highly recommended). Would definitely recommend staying here 1-2 nights before or after your Tikal tour."
30,"Stayed 2 nights and enjoyed it. The jungle setting and proximity to Tikal are great & so is the pool. The room was also nice.  The meals are good but pricey, there was no hot water and the wifi didn’t work the night that I really needed it. They don’t provide filtered water, you have to buy bottle water which seems a bit stingy. The staff were helpful. 3 and a half stars. "
50,"Spent three nights at Jungle Lodge August 2018.  Room was spotless, functional, and beautifully located amid the Peten jungle.   The staff was very helpful w/ tour planning, the restaurant served tasty, reasonably priced meals, and my tour guide, Tony Ortiz, was excellent.  Tony led me on the sunrise tour of Tilal and a half day tour of Uaxatun; really interesting, funny, and well informed guide.  I'd tour w/ Tony anytime."
50,"The location could not have been more convenient; it was a short 10-minute-walk to the Tikal ruins. Because of its location, power is limited; they cut-off power by a certain time at night, which means no air conditioners. Their staff could do better at meeting guest needs. If possible, avoid their below-par food; the restaurant menu looks appetizing, but the food is not good."
40,"We stayed here two nights to see the sunset and sunrise in Tikal. You do pay a premium but it is a tourist destination so don't be surprised. the smoothies are awesome. The service staff is great. The food is typical Guatemalan. Beer is expensive. The rooms are comfortable and quiet, the showers are warm. Worth staying here for the pool and location. "
50,"This place is special - it forces you to go without internet and tv and in the national park, there is basically no cell reception. I was really anxious about not getting email, because I was leaving my work with other people and couldn't monitor - but I just had to let it go. It sounds silly to say that is scary, but for me it really is. They are very, very accommodating and helpful in booking activities that you request. I whole heartedly recommend it, but be ready for total disconnection. When I visited, it wasn't too hot so the lack of electricity - and thus fan - wasn't a problem. You only have hot water when the electricity is on (about 5 hours a day), but on the heat, a cool shower is often exactly what is called for. "
40,"It's a really charming little hotel and perfectly located. My room was clean and functional.  You need to be aware that electricity is turned off during ""night"" (around 10.00 pm till next morning). The food was good and the pancakes at breakfast were appreciated ;)"
50,We were very pleased to stay at such a nice hotel in such an amazing setting.  The whole hotel was very clean with a lovely dining room and amazing patio/pool area.  We walked into the jungle at 4:00am and had a magical experience sitting on top of one of the Mayan temples watching the sun rise and listening to the howler monkeys.  This was an experience we will never forget.  By staying at the Hotel Tikal we arrived at the temple prior to the group who arrived later from Flores.  As a result we had the place to ourselves which added greatly to the mystical aspect of being in such an old place watching the sun rise.  Truly unforgettable!  This hotel has a rather unusual feature of limiting the access to electricity at various times.  There was a good light in the rooms during
30,"The room was very basic, the first night hot water and draining were not working, we also could not sleep because the snoring by next door, but they charged  $80+ /day, plus a $25 + 16% 3 hour morning tour.  A lady stayed at another hotel in the park told us she paid $85 for a bungalow and a morning tour.  A much better deal."
10,"The only good thing about this hotel is the location. Rooms are dingy and in need of an update and the wifi only works in the restaurant. The worst thing about the hotel is a member of staff who goes the name of Cesar who speaks good English with an American accent. He is out to sting gringos on tours and shuttle buses and should be avoided at all costs. Get your information from tourist info rather than Cesar, or you could end up paying up to three times more than you need to. He tried to charge my husband and 60USD each for a one way trip to Flores. We also witnessed him charging two innocent female backpackers a high price on his sunrise tour and then he boasted to us about the amount he'd charged them and said he'd give us the tour for a third of that cost. Not cool.  We"
50,"Really cozy and comfortable hotel, food in restaurant is delicious, rooms are big and and with amazing view from windows. You can hear monkeys at night :) Staff is friendly and provides great service. Only one bad thing is wi-fi only in lobby and restaurant."
50,"Nice views and sounds from this hotel! The cost is about the same as any USA lower priced hotel. You can hear the animals at night and my kids loved that. It also makes it easier to go to any dawn/dusk tours because the hotel is in the park. Worth the try, rooms are average like a Motel 6 for example."
30,Friendly welcome to this low cost hotel located right next to the entrance of the park. (Check online for 1/2 price specials).  Comfy bed. Room was a bit dated and had little privacy. Free internet in the restaurant area. Menu is limited and a bit pricey but remember that you are in the jungle. Avoid room 1A as its right next to the restaurant. We booked their sunrise tour which was conducted by Cesar. A really great guide. 
40,"My husband and I stayed here in early May in order to catch a sunrise tour of the ruins. With the early morning fog, we didn't see the sun, but the experience of waking up with the jungle was more than enough to meet our expectations. Our guide, Caeser, was very knowledgeable and pointed out the smallest details that could have been easily overlooked. The hotel and food were expensive overall, but again, it was the the experience that made the trip. "
50,"We stayed at Tikal Jungle Lodge one night and loved it! Before our arrival, they assisted us in coordinating trips, transportation, etc. Upon our arrival, we were happy to be able to check in early as we were super tired from the trip. We were first given a bungalow close to the reception but asked to switch it to a more remote location which was quickly accommodated. We ended up in bungalow 20 which was perfectly wonderful. We did not experience any mosquitos and all mosquito nets were perfectly safe. Some folks here stated issues with the limited electricity which was absolutely no problem for us. You can always charge your phone and the electricity is only limited a few hours each day. We hardly noticed it. The food in the restaurant was fantastic and reasonably priced. Staff"
40,"Second visit to Tikal, last time i stayed at Jaguar Lodge so thought we'd have a change.  Really nice room, really clean with chairs outside.  Lovely bathroom.  Food is good.  Grounds lovely.  GREAT location. Good pool.  Everything  v nice but some of the waiting staff let the place down.  Some are nice but some are awful.   The first day we arrived having travelled in from Houston via Belize City.  So a long journey..... We sat in the restaurant for 45 minutes before we managed to get a drink  (and that involved asking several times) - and then the drinks that arrived were not what we ordered.   Breakfast  waitress acted like we were really getting in the way of her day.  We asked for a second cup of coffee and she spent a long time explaining that it would cost extra and then"
40,"We stayed two nights--love the jungle setting and the pool was nice too.  The rooms are quiet and the hotel is close to the ruins.  Do check your mattresses for bedbugs, though, as we were bitten in room 10 (near the pool)."
40,We booked this hotel for a family of 5 people. That always is a problem because most hotels have rooms for maximum 4 people. This hotel is no exception. We had to rent two rooms and this made the bill quite formidable in the end.  So much for all the complaints. The two rooms were beautiful and quite luxurious. Electricity is scarce and during some hours of the day and at night there is no electricity (although the fans kept on working which gave us the much needed relief against the heat). Bring lights with you.  Being in the lodge and close to the Tikal Park means that you can enter the park as often as you want. We went back late in the evening and early in the morning and found hardly any other tourists in the park. That was very good for all our pictures. Being in the park
50,"The hotel is in a beautiful setting with monkeys, birds and other wildlife all around.  We had dinner in their restaurant and enjoyed our meal.  It was priced very reasonably.   Also, we booked the sunrise tour and found Antonio the guide to be a delight.  Make sure to bring flashlights if you book the sunrise tour.   I worried about the heat at night but I slept comfortably and didn't see any insects in the room.   Wifi in the lobby worked fine.   All in all a very nice stay."
40,"This was the most we paid for any of our hotels in Belize and Guatemala. The room was fine... actually quite large. The pool was nice. The food at the restaurant was hit-and-miss. We really appreciated that they packed a bag breakfast for me and my son so that we could enjoy an early morning in the park. That proximity made it all worthwhile. It was really nice to sleep in the park and not have to bother with a shuttle. We didn't do the sunrise tour, but we were in the park by 6am when the jungle was still waking up and there were few other visitors. It definitely justified the high price tag. "
30,The location is great for visiting the park but you just have the basics.  The most challenging thing was the electric.  It's on from about 7am to 8am and then 6-9:30pm.  The food was good and drinks at the hotel bar are at or more than US prices.  I understand this is a park hotel but the fan only working a few hours made it really hot.  They do have a nice pool.
40,Food was good expensive but good We had no issue with the electricity and the hot water. It is a basic hotel so if you are planning to do an early tour I will recommended if not will look for alternative options closer to the airport
50,"Amazing location, excellent staff, a great restaurant and truly an opportunity to relax after an outing in the jungle....in a lovely pool no less.  Management went out of their way to create an amazing experience for my family and we had a terrific visit.  Thanks again!"
50,"We chose to stay inside Tikal and glad we did.  The room was quiet, large with 2 double beds and two singles. Beds were comfortable.  Large pool which was great after hiking around Tikal.  We had dinner and breakfast included.  Tasty but nothing spectacular.  Dinner was a choice of 5-6? options and breakfast 3-4??.  Sorry can't remember exactly.  There were dozens of ants in the shower doors but living in Costa Rica for the past 15yrs, it didn't bother me.   Front desk has spray but remember you are in the jungle:-) Sunrise tour - highly recommend this.  Tour guide was very knowledgeable.  Make sure to have a small flashlight as it's dark when you leave the hotel. It was cloudy so not a great sunrise pic but loved sitting in the quiet listening to the jungle wake up."
30,"The hotel is good and there is electricity 24/7 which is great. The restaurant though is complete disaster and everything we ordered was really bad (6 out of 6 different dishes) stay in the hotel, go eat somewhere else!"
10,We had dinner here and the cheeseburgers are small and expensive.  They also taste bad. Fries were good and Moza beer is great. We were camping at the park campground and after seeing the one crowded platform at the Jaguar Inn we we're glad we camped at the park campground.
40,"A quiet place to rest and reflect on the amazing ruins of Tikal.  The rooms are simple and clean.  Showers are adequate, though hot and cold water does fluctuate a bit at times.  The courtyard between the restaurant and the rooms is great.  I stayed in a first floor room and it was a tad noisy due to the occupants upstairs, but that was also on New Year's Eve.  It seemed atypical.  Go out to the parking lot after dark to catch a glimpse of the stars.  You can get a guide to come and meet you in the pre-dawn dark and hike in to watch the sunrise from the top of Temple IV- just an indescribably cool experience.  The food in the restaurant is quite good, and I have fond memories of lazy evenings spent on the patio enjoying a few cold Gallos and listening to the jungle's evening"
20,"There is a campingside from the same hotel, the tents are a bit small for two but ok, the showers are very dirty they don't clean them - never! We also eat there it was average, food was cold when we got it, would give the food max. 3 out of 5. We wouldn't stay there again, even it was a real jungle experience."
40,"We got a good deal last minute when we booked online (50% off) so we thought it was worth it. It was clean and adequate, nice surroundings, and spacious rooms. For us though it was a matter of wanting to spend the night so that we could catch the sunset, then the sunrise the following morning.    The hotel has rules about what hours there is hot water and wifi etc. but remember you're in the middle of the jungle so don't complain!  Tikal one day tickets can be issued after 3pm on the day before. Just don't arrive in the park before this as you'll have to wait at the main gate which a 10 minute drive away from the actual entrance until 3pm.  If you need a guide see Little Caesars Travels. Ask for Caesar at the hotel, very informative and helpful, with great english."
50,This hotel is a modern facility on the drugs of the Tikal Park. It was a great location for our sunrise park tour. As promised they awoke us at about 3:30 am so we could meet our guide at 4. Our room was clean and comfortable and we really enjoyed that hot shower. The restaurant is tastefully decorated and the staff was very responsive. I would certainly return and stay a little longer next time.
50,"We loved our three-night stay at the Jungle Inn.  The rooms are clean, modern and comfortable casitas with little patios where you can sit and enjoy nature.  As others have noted, you can only access wifi in the lobby and electricity runs only at certain hours, but the fan works all the time.  We didn't find it too hot in the rooms.  Unfortunately the pool wasn't working when we were there, but the lodge has a nice game room with a billiards table.  The restaurant is ok, but I wish there had been fewer ""American"" choices and more local, Guatemalan food.  There are a few restaurants just outside the park though that serve more traditional fare.  Tikal is absolutely stunning and I would recommend at least a few days there.  We did a full day tour, as well as a night and sunrise"
40,"We loved our room, the beds were super comfortable, the toiletries were amazing. It's a hop skip and a jump from Tikal ruins. You can't get closer. The restaurant, bar and front desk service was slow and not very friendly. Food was good though."
50,"I stayed here for 2 nights and the grounds were great, swimming pools, flowers and good restaurant.   The staff was helpful and they had great tours as well as guides.  You are in the park so that is creates a great experience, but there is not much to do at night unless you do the night tour.  The rooms were clean and very nice.  Please note for cold weather people (like myself) there is no AC and the electricity gets turned off at night.  It does get very hot in the room, but you are in the jungle."
40,"My friends and I spent one night at Jungle Lodge and the experience wasn't bad given the fact that we were literally in the jungle. It is by no means luxurious, but it's also better than other places where I've stayed in the past.  PROS: #1 The location can't be beat. It is LITERALLY right outside the entrance to Tikal Park. #2 The cabins are modern, clean and had more space than I expected. #3 The staff was incredibly helpful and accommodated my friends and me as best as they could. We arrived at the Lodge around 10PM, which is normally when they shut off power for the night. They graciously offered us a 30-minute grace period so we could get ourselves ready for bed. #4 I can honestly say that my room appeared to be completely bug free. No roaming ants or mosquitoes buzzing"
20,"Came to Hotel Tikal expecting exactly what we got...no surprises one way or another.  It's an Eco lodge with limited amenities.  Perhaps Jason, who gave a previous review, was able to make our stay better as we found the staff accommodating, the food tasty, and the facility relatively clean.  The pool is clean and provides a great way to spend a lazy afternoon after an early morning hike to Tikal.  The battery powered light was enough to get us through for a short period of time.  The toughest thing for me was sleeping in the heat as there is no AC.  You are in the jungle, so don't be surprised if you have a visit from a small local critter(s)."
10,"We stayed here for one night as we wanted to see the sunrise over the temples - so we were very limited on choice.  This is in a great location. We have travelled the world and stayed in many hotels, this is by far the worst experience we have ever had. The first room we were given was disgusting so we asked to change, this seemed to be a problem but we were moved to an equally disgusting room, although bigger than the first - at this point we gave up as the staff do not speak English.  Our room was dirty with damp bedding and rusty fittings.  On top of this the electric is on for a limited amount of time in the evening and morning so you have to time your showering accordingly - saying that, the shower is no more than a trickle of water. Our dinner experience was not much"
40,"We were a party of 3 visiting Tikal ruins. The hotel offered us a great package including 2 meals and a sunrise tour. The room was clean & comfortable and right next to a wonderful swimming pool where we spent much time relaxing. Our sunrise tour guides were friendly and highly knowledgeable. The food was really good and we thought very reasonably priced. Within walking distance of the ruins - so convenient! Intermittent power outages and low-signal, not the place to come for work, rather, this is a place to unplug and be immersed in nature. Overall a fantastic time at Hotel Tikal. "
10,"This place is wildly overpriced. I had to change rooms because the shower was a dribble. In 3 nights I still only had one decent hot shower. They charge 13 Q for a coke, while a few hundred metres away the park restaurant charges 5 Q. They were even going to charge me extra for the milk in my tea! The owner of the hotel is really mean to her staff. A waiter made a mistake with the meal of another guest, and the guest was told that the cost of the meal (58Q) would come out of his wages (75Q a day). The staff all look terrifed of making mistakes. They don't give you the information you need, probably because they don't have it."
30,The room was clean and had all we needed for one night. The tour guide knew a lot and therefore the tour in as super interesting! We did the early morning tour but did not see the sunrise due to clouds. The restaurant is super expensive! They charged a lot for only a very basic lunch! The most expensive restaurant we had in all Guatemala and we did go to other expensive restaurants in Antigua. 
30,"The hotel staff was very nice and rather helpful. The room was quite humid, but that's what you get for being in the middle of a tropical jungle! We were told that the hot water was only on during certain hours, but to our greatest surprise we had hot showers outside of those time frames.  The food was nothing special in the restaurant and everything at Tikal is excessively priced. But the room was clean and the bed was quite comfortable! Needless to mention that the hotel is perfectly located, at a 1 min walk from the entrance of the park!"
20,"This review is about the hotel, not about its location. I and my husband stayed at room #10 which is close to the restaurant and is on the ground level. This particular room has a king size bed but the furnishing is outdated. I was not certain if the sheets were changed from the customers before or they were just worn out that bad. Very limited toiletries in the bathroom and just two towels for both of us. The ceiling fan has only one option, the fastest possible and it can make you sick easily. That's why you can't use it for a long time. No privacy without curtains. Front window looks to the common grounds, side window looks right to the bedroom of the next door neighbor. It would be nice if there's some kind of fence between the bungalows. The major issue were the bugs at"
40,"On planning my trip I was concerned about this night in Tikal after reading the negative reviews about many of the hotels.  Compared to most of the places I stayed on my tour of Belize/Guatemala the Jaguar Inn was of a much HIGHER quality.  The only thing they don't have is A/C.  Even the talk about limited times for hot water are over blown.  I took a shower at noon (just before checkout time) expecting it to be cold and there was plenty of hot water.  I would stay here again without hesitation.  My only word of caution would be to avoid the tour guide named Cesear who loiters around this place.  He is not good on many levels.    About Tikal in general, this hotel is in the Park.  HOWEVER, you will be subjected to the same entrance exit issues as everyone else. If you arrive"
50,"Where to start. If you're going to Tikal, it's all about the ruins and nature. The Jaguar offers a quiet rest point with food and water right at the park gates. The room was well appointed and the restaurant fantastic. If you're new to Maya history by all means hire a guide, but if you've done a few the day pass lets you wander in and out at will."
30,"This hotel is surrounded by the jungle sounds. Great scenery, nice shaded seating area and very close to the entrance of the ruins. The room was plain and simple with ceiling fans. Be prepared for the humidity. Even the sheets feel humid.  Cons: Water collected in the tub. Very humid."
50,"There is not a whole lot of choice for lodging in Tikal.  This one is clearly the best!  This almost seems like a luxury resort.  The restaurant was very good with good service.  There is a play room next to the front desk with a movie theater, foosball and a pool table.  The pool is very nice and great for kids because there's not deep areas.  The best part of the hotel is the location!  It's the closely place to stay to Tikal.  It is seriously only a 3 minute walk from the lobby to the checkpoint entrance.  We paid for the master suite and it was awesome having our own jacuzzi.  We had little kids with us and it was nice closing the sliding door to the sitting area so they could have their own room. The place had nice soap and shampoo and the bed & furniture was nice.  The"
50,"I went here with my daughter. We had a wonderful time. Electricity is only available at certain times of the day, as is wifi, but that was OK with me. My 25 year old daughter probably felt differently. Tikal is jaw-dropping. I NEED to go back, repeatedly."
50,"Our travel agent recommended the Tikal Inn, but after visiting TripAdvisor we changed to Jungle Lodge and were very happy with our decision. It is in the midst of a refurbishing and the benefits of that change are very nice. The common area - while being refurbished - is fantastic. It includes the restaurant, nice bar and game room with a pool table, foosball table and theater seating with a television. The pool was a nice feature but is a bit aged. It even has wifi in the common areas and the pool, but that's it. Plus power turns off a few times during the day and around 10p.  The staff was warm and hospitable. The restaurant had a nice menu with a wide range of foods - which was very important because since there are few places to eat in the park. The food was also fairly"
50,"After looking at dark pictures on the web, I told my partner that we may be ""roughing"" it a bit, and wasn't quite sure what to expect. We were both pleasantly surprised with a comfortable, modern room and bath, helpful staff, wonderful little pool to cool off in after a hot afternoon at the ruins and a restaurant with good food. This lodge is in the middle of the jungle, expect everything that comes along with that environment. But I would suggest to the management that they have a professional take photos of their place, as the current ones don't do it justice. We really enjoyed our time in Tikal and this was the perfect place to relax as well as take full advantage of the close proximity to Tikal."
50,"Myself, my husband and our 24 year old daughter spent a night in a junior suite.  The room was very comfortable for the three of us, and the bathroom was large and very nice.  It was extremely hot when we were there, so at night when the ceiling fan stopped it felt pretty muggy, but then we were getting up at 3:30 for the sunrise tour, so it was not that we would have gotten much sleep anyway.  Since it was so hot, we were very happy to have the pool after our 5 hour tour on the first day - I could have sat in that pool for hours.  We saw and heard a lot of wildlife - we were happy with our choice of the jungle lodge."
50,"We had a room on the far end pf the property and each walk to the pool or dining area was an animal watching experience- monkeys, birds, mammals, insects, flowers. Good food and excellent guides. Do the early bird tour for an unforgettable sunrise. "
50,"Staying in he jungle was a crazy experience you definitely feel like its in the middle of the jungle, with our block of rooms in a wooded area away from the main hotel. the room didn't have ac and the fan didn't work at night as the electricity shut off at 9 but it was absolutely fine. The sunrise tour operated by the hotel was amazing and seemed good value with a big breakfast and dinner included! Food was delicious and staff very friendly so would definitely recommend!"
40,"To be able to walk from your bed to Tikal in 10 minutes is awesome in itself. But staying in a thatch roof room with a private bathroom, that's semi-luxury: jungle style. The grounds are really nice, and the pool was great. Our bungalow was clean and comfortable, with minimal bugs. Since you're kind of stuck eating only at the lodge, you can't expect fine dining, but the food was pretty good. Here's a tip we learned a little late: Book the sunrise or sunset tour through the lodge, and it includes dinner AND breakfast the next day. That actually saved us money. Our favorite experience in Guatemala was falling asleep to the sound of howler monkeys and waking up to Tikal at our doorstep. The shuttle times arranged through the lodge were a little restrictive however, since we needed"
40,"This is a very nice and comfortable hotel. Located at the entrance of the park. We stayed in a bungalow it was very clean and big enough for 4 adults, 2 queen beds and 2 twin size beds. Nice pool. Traditional Guatemalan Breakfast and a choice of spaghettis, fajitas o chicken for dinner all included for $235. The sunrise tour and shuttle from the airport were also included, however you will have to pay $10 to shuttle back to the airport or for a better and cheaper deal negotiate with the guys outside the hotel offering the shuttle for Q30 = $6 per person. Keep in mind that Tikal is a protected national park so because of that there is not electricity after  9:30pm, no AC but there are fans when there is electricity. Also WI fi is only available at the reception area, and only if"
40,"Firstly - the primary reason of your stay at this hotel is to see the ruins of Tikal. It's a privilege to be able to stay in a hotel so close to the ruins and in an incredible jungle setting, full of wildlife. The rooms were clean and beds comfortable, however, as many reviews have stated, there's no electricity in the evenings - this is because it's in the middle of a pristine jungle!  STAYING HERE OR IN FLORES: If you want the true jungle experience, and to experience the sounds of the howler monkey's in the morning not to mention watching the sunrise over Tikal, best to stay here. We arrived just before midday and spent 2 nights. That gave us one entire day to experience the ruins. Best times to visit are in the early morning & late afternoon, as it's too hot during the day."
40,"My husband and I recently stayed here for 3 nights while in Tikal. We stayed in bungalow 10 which doesn't share walls with any other bungalow and found it quite comfortable. We also really enjoyed the restaurant for breakfast and dinners each day. We had our own guide the first day, so did not do any tours offered through the Inn. We went on our own at sunrise and sunset.   The staff was all very friendly and helpful. Our room was clean and comfortable, but not fancy, but that wasn't what we were looking for. There is electricity available in the evenings but it is battery powered, so you are encouraged to minimize your use of electricity after 9:00 pm. Honestly, by that time, we were ready for bed anyway so it wasn't a big deal for us. We did not have to pay for wifi so I'm not"
30,"okay hostel but good location. it's kinda either this one or hotel Tikal inn (go there) the room was nice. but the manger and tour guide was very pushy to do everything they said. but we managed to find other offers, better ones. so don't be afraid to go to someone else. "
40,"This is the smallest of the 3 inns in Tikal National Park and it is lovely.  My son and I enjoyed the close proximity to the park, as well as the quiet dark nights.  Our room was clean, with windows and screens very clean which was wonderful.  It would be good if more hooks or railings were put up so clothes and towels could be spread out while drying out - as it was very humid.  Staff was friendly and the little restaurant was convenient with simple tasty fare.  All in all, we'd happily stay there again!"
50,"It's a really nice place to stay at, really close to Tikal Park and really nice installations. The rooms are clean and the bathroom as well. The food is average but the service is good and it seems like the best place to stay at. They have hot water in a close schedule, about 2 or 3 hours. "
50,"This is the 4th time I have stayed at the Jungle Lodge in Tikal National Park and will go back again . . . I just love the setting.  Newly updated and remodeled lodges, wildlife all around with howler monkeys in the evenings.  The lodge is a well kept period setting with a great restaurant.  All of the food was good and reasonable.  The Sunrise tour with Carlos as exceptional.  Ifyou want tostay in the park, the Jungle Lodge is the PLACE!"
40,"Several colleagues and I arranged a tour and overnight stay at Tikal through the Hotel Tikal Inn. The inn arranged all the events, including tours and passes for the National Park. The menu for meals was limited, but meals were decent and served in a tropical style dining room.   The rooms were reasonably sized and comfortable, but no A/C and power only during limited hours. A great experience, but the heat and humidity knocks you out after a while. "
40,"I am tempted to give 5 stars for the way the architecture fit the beautiful plantings,, pool, and surroundings in general. However, five stsrs would surpise those lioking for airconditioning, and 24 hour electricity. They do a fantadtic job in a remote area. The generator runs for a limited time and wifi is (wonderfully) limited as well.  Staff was helpful, although communicatiom would have neen better if my Spanish wasn't so limited. Food is okay (but this is a remote area, shouldn't expect much). There is a nice local honey for breakfast pancakes. General food tip:choose foods that say Mayan or otherwise are a local choice -we found those to be best."
30,"Hello all, we just spent 5days at Hotel Tikal Inn: here is the skinny... First great beds, they were very firm.  Second, decent pool & no AC was not an issue. Thirdly, breakfast was Awesome!  Fourth, great location & lots of toilet paper & complementary bottles of H2O.  Big issue with lack of assistance with currency exchange & Wi-Fi... almost never worked in 5 days.  I only got one text & 2 emails sent in five days.  Big tip, easy to book Tikal tickets at Hotel & definitely worth the price.  Sunrise tour rocks, & you get complementary meals so it's a win win.  Don't bother with sunset tour it us better at Yaxha.  Our guides Elias for the sunrise tour & Josue for Uauxtun(sorry about the spelling) & Yaxha were AMAZING!!!!!!"
40,"We stayed in one of the bungalows next to the pool at Tikal Inn. The room was adequately sized, with two double beds. After touring Tikal in the evening, we made good use of the pool before dinner. Our package included dinner and breakfast, although we missed breakfast due to being on a tour of Tikal while it was served. Dinner was okay - not the greatest food I've ever had, but not the worst. Be aware that drinks (even soft drinks) are not included with dinner, and must be purchased separately with cash (no credit card purchases under 100 QTZ). We did bring a flashlight with us, which was put to good use after 10p when the electricity was shut off. The staff let us check out prior to our sunrise tour as we were unsure if we'd be back before 11a and allowed us to stash our"
40,We booked this place on our family trip to Belize and Guatemala. We were there for 3 nights but two would've been enough. We arrived after 3 so our park pass was stamped for the following day which gave us the opportunity to visit the park that night and the day after. Since we were traveling for 8 hours (we came from the cayes) we skipped going to the park that night. Additionally we had booked a zip line canopy tour for the day after we arrived to Tikal which was the same day our park pass was stamped for. We didn't realize that we would be given a pass to the park as soon as we arrived. We though you would be able to purchase the pass when you wanted to go into the park. So we decided to book the sunrise tour for the following morning which starts at 4am. We were met by our
50,"For Mayan archeology and wildlife this place cannot be beaten.  The ruins are outstanding and cover a very large area - all within walking distance of the hotel.  We were woken each morning - very early - by the howler monkeys above our cabin; the spidermonkeys were much quieter!.  Excellent birding opportunitiesarond the site and by the ruins. Excellent pool and bar area to use after visiting the ruins. Restaurant with a reasonable choice served by friendly helpful staff; good menu-based breakfasts (NOT buffet). Good sized rooms with good air conditioning, but limited electricity supply at night - so take a good torch. Air VERY humid and whilst we had no problems with insects, recommend to take deet and use it."
30,"The triple room was large and relatively clean. There was a ceiling fan but no a/c, which was OK. The water was hot enough. The hotel has a small pool, which was refreshing after walking around ruins all day. The electricity is available during the evening only, so charge up any devices accordingly. The hotel restaurant is expensive, by Guatemalan standards, and the food is not bad but pretty boring. The restaurant is very pleasant, though, with a nice large verandah. The staff were very friendly. One of the best features of the hotel is its proximity to the ruins at Tikal. Just a few minutes, and you're there."
10,"This is a follow up review to the one I posted in April 2018. Although, my stay was pleasant. I was shocked and surprised to see three charges from the restaurant for one meal. The charge was valid but the other two charges of the same amount were not. I had a copy of the voucher signed and the credit card statement reflecting the three charges. I contacted the staff and sent picturee of statement and voucher but they just kept giving me the run around even thought I had evidence that the charges were invalid. Dishonest, unreliable and deceptive are some of the adjectives to describe the staff, back office and management."
50,"We stayed for one night and had a wonderful time. We were very surprised by the standard of our bungalow - the picture in the advert did not do justice to the lovely accommodation that we had! The staff were very welcoming, friendly and helpful at all times.  We ate dinner and breakfast at the hotel. Both meals were delicious, if a little pricey, but then we were in the jungle. The service was good at both meals. We enjoyed relaxing after a sunset tour - so lovely to not have to do the journey back to Flores! The pool was lovely - not big but perfectly adequate. And the howler monkeys kept people entertained. People had suggested that we should go straight to Flores after visiting Tikal and we are so glad that we spent the night at the lodge. It was a shame to leave!"
50,"We enjoyed our 1 night stay in one of the premium rooms during our Tikal visit.  The room was very clean, spacious, and convenient for our visit to the park.  It was magical falling asleep and waking up to the sounds of the jungle.  We saw and heard more howler monkeys just outside of our room than inside the park.  The staff was uniformly helpful, accommodating, and kind.  The WiFi at the lobby area worked well.  We didn’t eat at the restaurant so cannot comment on it.  Highly recommended."
40,"Tikal is one of the most amazing places I have been to, especially when you think that it was built so long ago. Visiting this place is one of the most humbling experiences ever. The Jaguar Inn is inside the national park and is echo friendly. The proximity to the park is the best feature as it allows you to take advantage of the tours. We definitely recommend the morning tour. Watching the sunrise on top of one of this ancient pyramids, while listening to the forest sounds is a once in a lifetime experience; we did it two days in a row. Breakfast is included and there is a number of choices to please everyone; we did not have any other meals here as we wanted to explore Flores as well. Wi fi is only available at the restaurant and is a bit slow, but the staff is very friendly"
40,"This is a great hotel to be close to the park, to make the morning tour to the archeological site and watch the sunset, is also in the middle of the tropical forest! The management def goes the extra mile to make customers happy! "
40,"We stayed here two nights. The staff was helpful with money exchange, information and organizing tours. Though it was slightly on the expensive side, the opportunities were fantastic. The sunrise tour organized by the hotel was unbelievable, listening to howler monkeys and watching the sunrise over the park. The beds were comfortable and rooms were clean. Restaurant was decent but food was available outside the hotel near the park entrance that is cooked by locals."
40,We stayed here for one night. We found the room clean with a comfortable bed. The shower was nice and hot during the available hot water hours. The food at the restaurant was decent. The manager was super friendly and helpful. It was certainly a nice option and very close to the ruins. 
30,I stayed two nights but one would have suffice. The hotel is clean and is just two minutes from the entrance of the park but I found the price of the rooms and the restaurant a bit too expensive. Higher prices for average quality but avoid the 1 hour journey from Flores.
10,"This my first time writing a review about a hotel and this hotel was bad. The food was not that great. Some people say that it was great. Maybe the people working had a bad day or something. It is over priced for one bad room. ""Oh but the pool was great"", well people who said that I agree with you because that, the music and the theme was the only things great. My mom felt bad for chosing this place but we tried to be positive. In all the place is pretty but the rooms are 👎. I wouldn't even give it one star. I would give it none. They try to charge you for everything they give you and even for water."
40,"I would come back here again. The location was perfect and the sunrise tour that they offered was incredible. The food was tasty and the pool was great. While the wifi connection was pretty limited, it was existent. The water wasn't warm, but it wasn't freezing either which is common for a lot of the places we stayed. The staff were very friendly and helpful."
40,"Stayed two nights at Tikal Inn, in their backwoods rooms C-12 through C-15 that only has power 6 hours a day (that means no fan or hot water most of the day). Food is much much better at Jaguar Inn next door and their wifi actually works so plan on heading over there. Both places take credit cards but there is a 10% fee to do so."
40,"My friends and I enjoyed our stay at Tikal Inn.  It was nice to get out of the madness of Flores, and it was definitely a perk to stay right at the park entrance.  We were pleased to find that the hotel was very nice with real beds and very nice bathrooms, especially near the dining room.   Electricity only ran a little in the evening and morning, but we didn't find that too cumbersome. The wifi was not working for any guests, but you are out in the jungle so we weren't that surprised.  The front desk staff were helpful in arranging our transport to the Belize border and the pool was a nice treat!  I'm glad we ""splurged"" and decided to stay in Tikal Inn.  It felt luxurious compared to some hostels we had stayed in previously."
20,"Our party of ten (two families with three children each) arrived and from the first moment were treated with little respect. They refused our request for one room for each family when we were willing to pay for an extra bed. They even showed us a room with six beds so we asked why we couldn't have that and another room with two doubles and they just refused. We were stuck. It was late when we arrived and we had no choice but to pay for a third room. The rooms were nice (electricity was limited to early morning and evening but the temperatures were bearable. The location inside the park couldn't be beat, waking every morning to the birds and howler monkeys was quite an experience. However the Inn told us we could leave the park and not pay the re-entry fee if we didn't plan on"
50,"If you would like to experience Tikal without rushing through the park you should plan to spend at least 1 night in Tikal. Keep in mind that Flores Airport is about an hour away from Tikal.  Jungle Lodge is a hotel in Tikal, right outside of the park.  Our guide Antonio was very friendly, accommodating and  knowledgeable about the park and it's history.  This hotel has a nice pool and the food in the restaurant is delicious (Tips are not mandatory, but do go a long way)   Don't forget that you have to get passes to get into the park, but you can get those at the bank next to the airport in Flores, just ask your driver to take you to get your passes.  While in Flores, you have to take a ride around the lake! it's beautiful. Enjoy!!"
50,I cannot say enough about this amazing place. The power is out from 10pm-6am and the howler monkeys entertain all night long! The on-site restaurant was delicious and reasonably priced. Tikal is a must-see and the Jungle Lodge is a must-stay. 
40,The communication prior to our arrival was great with a member of staff arranging a sunset tour via their Facebook messenger app. Unfortunately when we got there there had been a miscommunication of times but not a huge deal and we went on the tour a little later than planned. The tour was good but I think if we were to do it again we’d pay less with a tour company outside of the park as our friends in those tours has the same service from what we heard and saw.  We couldn’t check in at 3pm as advertised but were upgraded to a room with a private bathroom. The room was spacious but had lots of critters (we’re in the jungle so to be expected). What was VERY strange was there were huge dead ants on one of the beds. They weren’t squashed though so we don’t know how the beds had
50,"We loved it here! We had a room with a shared bathroom and it was really nice, like a “flashpackers”. The restaurant is great and the pool is divine! They let you swim even after check out (essential after a sweaty day in the park) The howler monkeys are often in the trees outside and definitely sound like dinosaurs at 4 in the morning haha. Such a wonderful experience!! "
40,"The location is in the park, past the security checkpoint- that's how close you are to the entrance.  It works out well where you can visit the park, jump in the pool til it cools off, then head back in.  Got the basic room with a shared bathroom.  The bathroom was the nicest part of the place. Don't get me wrong, the room was fine, but it's just a bed, clothing rack and bedside table with a lamp.  The bathrooms are new as of a few years ago with decent showers.  The restaurant menu is mostly American style but was shocked how good the Habanero Shrimp were - grilled to perfection.  I liked how you can put each meal on your room tab and if you want something different, you can easily walk to the two other hotels that are a block away from this one.  The nearby restaurant Comedor"
40,"Ok so I was confused reading the websites/reviews about how the whole Tikal park works before I visited. I'm going to do everyone a favour and explain it before the hotel review....  ...The Tikal ruins are in the middle of a national park (about 20km inside). There are three hotels inside the park a 5 minute walk to the entrance, this is one of them. If you search for Tikal hotels it will also provide you ones in El Remate, this is a good 30 minutes drive away. Flores another 30-40 minutes on top. It is hypothetically possible to do sunrise tours (enter the ruins in the dark and watch the sun come up) from Flores but you're going to be getting up about 2.30 for a 3am bus instead of 4-4.30 in the park hotels. Likewise there are sunset tours but these are not so popular as you've"
40,"The hotel is inside Tikal National Park. Staff is really helpful and the manager speaks English. Attention to the reservation center - they did not tell the hotel we would arrive very late and we were almost left outside. Despite of this, I recommend the hotel for the experience of staying close to nature, right inside the park."
40,"Really enjoyed our night in the jungle. We went the day before and arrived about 4pm after a long days travel but wanted to see the sunrise the next day. The guards on the entrance gate to the park where we stayed wouldn't let us in unless we bought a pass for that day. So we wern't able to buy one for the next day even though we were arriving so late and wouldn't get to go around much. This really annoyed us because the pass isn't cheap. The hotel did nothing to warn us of this.  Anyway hotel is in a good place, you can hear the buzz of the jungle at night and it's clean."
40,"Situated right in the park and easy walking distance to the Tikal site, it's great to stay here so you can easily go on the sunrise or sunset tours, or just wander about on your own without too many crowds. Nice setting with basic but fine restaurant - a good place to chill Out. The staff was friendly and helpful. Unfortunately we had gotten ripped off by a transport company in Flores (regarding our onward travel from Tikal to San Ignacio), which we could have organised through the Jaguar Inn for half the price. SO be careful not too book much in Flores!! There are shuttle companies at Tikal just near the hotel that are cheaper & helpful. We went on the sunrise tour (arranged by the hotel) with their guide named Caesar - he was wonderful!! Ask for him. Again, don't book any"
40,"We stayed at this place for three nights.  It's definitely worth the money to stay right in the park as you're walking distance to everything.    We did the sunrise tour and although Cesar was fighting a pretty nasty kidney infection, he led us on a four hour adventure at four am which was life altering.   We were the only two people on the tour which made it all the more special.    The rooms were okay.  They were clean and had no AC but great fans and screened windows so it was all good.  We had asked for a king bed but got two queens and a single instead, which was kind of unfortunate.  On the upside, we were in one of the upper cabanas so we hung out on the deck and watched the rainforest.  The food at the restaurant was okay.  I would definitely stay here again with the"
40,You will definitely feel like you are in the jungle!!! About 430am you'll hear the howler monkeys really yelling at full voice!!! You'd better bring strong ear plugs if you don't want to wake up!!  The electricity goes off at 10pm so if you want to charge your devices you'd better do it early on.   It's hot with no AC so you might want to bring a portable fan that runs on batteries.   Nice place. Good food!   Wifi barely works.   I'd stay there again!
40,"We really enjoyed our stay. When we got to our room, there was only one bed, and we were traveling with our two sons. They were happy to give us the keys to a room with a double bed & two single beds. The rooms are super clean and beds were comfortable. This motel is in Tikal National Park, and not close to a variety of restaurants or shopping. Staying here, you get the true jungle experience and magnificence of the Mayan ruins not far away. There was an outdoor pool. We ate both dinners in the restaurant a few steps from our room. We took the Sunrise Tour; totally worth getting up at 3:30! "
20,The only good thing about this place is that it was close to the national Park. There's no  air-conditioning and the rooms are very simple and the electricity gets cut off at 10 PM. We almost died from  heat exhaustion in those rooms. I don't know why it is rated 3 to 4 stars it should be 1 to 2 stars. 
50,"My wife and I and 4 other friends stayed at the Hotel Tikal Inn in early June 2016 and had an excellent experience. We purchased the bungalow/dinner/breakfast combo which we thought was a great deal. Keep in mind there is not much at Tikal. Just a few hotels/restaurants and a visitor center. Also keep in mind Tikal is located 34 km north of the nearest town. It is a national park on the border of a couple other national parks and a world renowned biosphere reserve. It is on the border of a lot of wilderness, in the middle of nowhere. Our bungalows were spotless clean, the staff was fantastically friendly and helpful, the meals were excellent. The pool was excellent after a hot day! And I couldn't write enough about the ruins. Amazing, powerful, magical. The park grounds were"
30,"Good location, near park entrance.  Refreshing pool, after very hot and humid tour through park.  Comfortable beds.  Nice staff brought me specially brewed local tea for upset stomach.  But beware.....no electricity except a couple hours in morning and evening!  Would have been nice to be able to run fan through the night!  Very limited meal choices in restaurant...all hot and heavy."
40,"We spent one night at Jungle Lodge Hotel and enjoyed our stay.  We were in a suite which included a king bed and a pull out sofa.  It worked fine for our family (our kids are 8 and 10 years old).  It was a little tight with the couch pulled out but we weren't in the room a lot so it wasn't a big problem.  The room itself was really nice - clean, recently updated, and nicely decorated.  The bathroom was nice too and had an indoor and outdoor shower.  The private outdoor area was lovely and even included a hot tub, which unfortunately we didn't get to use.    The grounds were pretty and I wish we had had more time to enjoy the property and pool but our schedule was pretty tight.  The restaurant was good.  We had a nice lunch there.  We also pre-ordered a packed breakfast the night"
40,"First of all, the location is unbeatable.  The pool was heavenly after a hot day hiking in the ruins.  Dining rom was lovely, food was delicious, wait staff were attentive -what more could you ask?  Cabins were clean with a huge bathroom including a huge bathtub.  The only slight- very slight - thing was that the bed was a bit hard and I had a difficult time sleeping in the heat. This is the jungle so limited electricity and none overnight, so no fan.  But, overall it was divine!"
40,"Our room was wonderful--not ostentatious, but with a cool jungle adventure vibe. From our private patio (complete with jacuzzi tub) surrounded by trees, we could sometimes see monkeys high up in the branches.  The hotel pool is small, but nice, with a bar and a lovely sitting area under the shade.  Again, the monkeys swing by at times.  The front desk staff is sometimes a little distracted, but friendly.  I had arranged transportation with them, but that fell through.  Thankfully, we had a Plan B--a private taxi driver who we found at Melchor de Mencos, who was very reliable.  They will arrange tours with private tour guides:  We were SUPER fortunate, and were assigned Tony Ortiz, an extraordinary, well-read, educated (somewhat older) gentleman who speaks excellent English, has"
40,"I loved staying here.  The rooms are quite sparse but very comfortable and the bathroom/shower (down the hall) were clean, modern and well lit. The pool area is lovely and the grounds as a whole are just beautiful.  Best part is the easy morning sunrise tour.  Do yourself a favor it's so worth the early morning rise.  Also nice is the short walk  to the ruins and roaming at your own leisure."
50,"The Jungle Lodge Hotel was very unique, set steps from the entrance of Tikal and right in the heart of the jungle. We are a family of four and stayed in a bungalow. It had up to date decor and was very clean.  The howler monkeys definitely keep you up for parts of the night which adds to the jungle experience. Staff was helpful and arranged tours, tickets and transportation. Their shuttle times were not always convenient depending on the flight you are taking.  The shuttle was over filled for one of the times we took it. They provide private transportation as well for a higher rate. The restaurant provided a large variety of choices for all meals. The food was amazing! The pool area was nice and provided a great place to cool off in the hot jungle. Would highly recommend staying"
50,I had an amazing time with my daughter on our one day tour. The location was just right and the staff was very friendly. The dinning in the restaurant for lunch was wonderful and the food was the Best!! I was born in Guatemala City and raised in the States and I can say my people are the best. I'm proud to be a Guatemalan. And i'm definitely coming back soon!!
30,"The good: Very close to the entrance to Tikal National park. We were upgraded to room 9. (But be aware that it is right next to the dining room. We were there at a quiet time, so it was not a problem, but I'll bet it gets quite noisy when the Inn is full.) The beds were comfortable, the bathroom was functional and all were clean. The pool was lovely, the grounds well kept, the food in the restaurant good. Staff were friendly and helpful. free WiFi in restaurant, but very spotty. (Its a jungle, you know!)  Not so good: I knew that electrical power was generator only and only at 6:30 - 8 am and 6-9:30 pm. I figured we had headlights and flashlights, so no big deal. But I didn't count on it being so hot and humid at this time of year. So, NO AC and NO FAN. I woke up drenched with"
40,"Stayed overnight in Tikal to do the sunrise tour. Booked a package through the hotel when we got there and I would highly recommend it. It was $25 per person and included dinner, breakfast, and a guided sunrise tour. Just a heads up - you only have electricity a couple hours of the day to charge electronics and no A/C at night and no fans in the rooms so it's pretty hot. Poor wifi so don't bet on planning your next hotel stay or tour while you're there. The food is awesome and the bar has some great drinks. Pool was very nice and necessary after the tour and the hot day."
50,"Great overnight trip in the park. Staff was friendly. Pool is a welcome reprieve after spending time in the park. Loved Roxy! The food choices are appropriate considering you are staying in the park with limited resources. Would stay again. They have an overnight pkg that includes a double room, transportation from your hotel in Flores to the Hotel, dinner, sunrise tour and breakfast."
50,"We didn't know what to expect when we learned we would be staying at a hotel inside the park. All I can say is, WOW. So glad we did! Tikal Inn was pretty amazing. The service was excellent, the location was perfect, we have not one complaint.  The most amazing experience was just lulling around the pool when suddenly monkeys start swinging and climbing the nearby trees. Toucans flying all around us. An agouti decided to munch an aperitif nearby. We saw all of this just when we were floating around the pool!   I know a lot of people may not like the fact that there is no Internet in the rooms (there is Internet in the lounge/lobby area), but you are coming to Tikal! Time to get away from it all! Experience nature and relax!   Also, you should know that since it is in the park,"
50,"Jaguar Inn is the best hotel you can get if you want to go to see the Mayan Rouins or just to experience a night in a nice place in the middle of the jungle. The hotel is beautiful, and we had the pleasure to meet and enjoy Cesar's professionally! He helped us out with a street tour seller that robbered us and we also went with him for the sunrise tour at the National Park and it was just beautiful! We highly reccomand him as a guide, such a cool man, really smart and with lots of charisma! his guidance was the most interesting ever! Prices are cheap too! Go with him and you won't regret for sure! The hotel's vibes are great, you can't hear a noise a night but the nature and birds and other animals!"
40,"When staying at a place like the Jaguar Inn Tikal, the first thing to remember is where you are.  You're in the middle of a jungle national park, 500 kilometers from the nearest real city.  With that in mind, the accommodations are pretty good.  And the staff are as helpful as possible given the limited resources available to them."
40,"If your budget is tight and you want to maximize your sightseeing dollars, they offer a limited amount of tents on premises. Very clean, air mattresses, sheets and bags are included. Showers for this area leave a bit to be desired, but if that makes the difference between 1 extra day in the park or not, go for it. Also, this is my second time in Tikal this year, and César is by far the most courteous, knowledgeable tour guide I have encountered out there...4 tours in 2 trips, and worth every penny."
50,"Tikal offers one of those truly authentic experiences that are so scarce nowadays and both of the hotels that are located inside the national park are affordable enough to let you relax and enjoy in direct contact with nature and still away from many of mass tourism annoyances, at least in september.  More specifically, I've seen many pre-hispanic ruins and these are some of the best. They are just stunning. Also, I've been to destinations where you're offered wildlife spotting and this was better than many of them, as I spent an afternoon watching spider monkeys play on the trees, as well as having the chance to spot beautiful birds, spiders, etc.   As for the hotel, its location made it ideal for living such an experience, while being some 500 mts away from the entrance to the"
50,"Its very good please for stay in jungle Tikal. Frendly staff and nice room. I like this atmposfere, near natur and invisible staff. When back to Tikal, stay in this hotel! :)  Small minus- internet conection is very slow."
50,"We have been here for a couple nights. A have not one complaint. Comments about ordinary tasting food are either from world class food critics or just wrong. Everything we had was amazing. Can recommend anything on the menu.   Our guide for the Tikal walk was very good. Knowledgeable and fine English. Good pace on a very hot day.  Equal parts ruins and jungle facts.   Staff have been amazing. Very clean, courteous, professional.   Be warned a sunrise tour rarely includes sunrise.  Maybe 3 days per month it is not cloudy in the morning. It will be less busy however. Worth the Q100?  Not sure. "
20,"The Jungle Lodge has a nice location next to the entrance of Tikal Park and the rooms are renovated, modern and enjoyable.  That may be all you need for a hotel in the jungle, but keep your expectations very low for the service, food and facilities.  In our short stay our toilet was broken (though fixed promptly), but for other reasons we never had hot water. The pool is old and the water was cloudy and a little discouraging.  The food was mediocre.  Most disappointing for us was the management and a very unfriendly, disinterested customer service.  We couldn't seem to get anyone to take our lack of hot water seriously.  When we asked for change to pay a tip to the guide, they simply refused to give us change.  They said we would need to buy food at the restaurant to get change."
50,"Beautiful place, very helpful staff, perfect location for visiting the national park. If you are looking for that quiet serene place, this is it.  Highly recommend.  Love the jungle setting with all the sounds of nature. "
30,"We initially didn't plan to stay at Tikal having booked our nights in Flores, but following advice on the forum and the thought of gaining an extra hour of sleep caused us to splurge a little and stay one night here. I was in contact with the staff in advance regarding tours and received information how about the archaeological sunrise tour and the ""complementary"" sunset one that covers other parts of Tikal. These group tours were priced higher then options I learned about online but the complementary tour sounded special so I opted for that one and booked the sunrise tour via Crasborn Travel which I warmly recommend. The good: very clean, friendly staff, swimming pool, right in nature - saw spider monkeys jump from tree to tree right above our room and heard the loud howler"
50,"The hotel was very nice with comfortable beds.  There a ceiling fan and light.  Depending on how much you pay, the fan runs all night long.  They turn off the main generator at around 10 PM.  There is a nice restaurant with limited WiFi.  There is phone service in some of the higher points in the park, but not in the hotel.  The nights are great, listening to the night sounds.  It was not as hot as I had thought, but summers might be a bit warm for a room with no A/C.  The staff were very friendly.  The food had an exotic flare that I did not care for.  It was not bad; and you can ask for the food without sauces. The breakfast was good.  I would stay here again. Very peaceful."
40,"I have not stayed at the other hotels in Tikal so I can't compare.  But, considering the constraints of running a hotel with limited power in a remote location, they do a decent job. The room was clean and the shower very good, even when the power was off.  The rechargeable light in the room was helpful when the power was off--most of the time.  We stayed in one of the Ranchon rooms and were fortunate to have a corner one--be sure to ask for one if you choose to stay here.  My sister and her husband got a center room and it got really hot at night.  Our room was actually comfortable, even slightly chilly at night.  Should you choose to book one of these rooms also be aware that it is a bit of a walk on a mulched pathway to the rooms--you cannot roll you rolling bag.  The good:  "
50,"Located within Tikal park this hotel is the middle priced of the three and has a pool, restaurant and overall great service. Power goes out throughout the day on a scheduled basis so beware. Rooms are spacious and clean."
50,We have stayed at the Tikal Inn 4 or 5 times over the years. We enjoy the peaceful grounds and the use of the pool. In the evening our front porch was a great place for wildlife spotting. This trip our room had a brand new bed and an emergency light source that wasn't there during our previous visits.
30,for being where I was this is a great stay...howler monkeys screaming and nature at it's best..recommend to everyone. We had a great time in Guatemala the people were very friendly and courteous..The wine is absolutely fantastic
40,"The cabanas are basic, but clean with comfortable beds and the pool is really nice on a hot day after spending several hours in the ruins.  The electricity and fans only run until 9 pm, so it can get hot at night, but was not too bad.  The food in the restaurant was okay and the internet (in the bar/restaurant area only ) was slow but functioned when the electricity was on.  Enrique, our tour guide for the sunset and sunrise tours, provided a lot of information about the ruins and the ways the Maya  lived in them, and was very good at spotting birds and animals.  Tikal is a special place and staying in the park is the best way to do the sunrise tour, which should not be missed.  The sun even cooperated for us!"
50,"Although slightly more expensive than the hotels in Flores it was worth it. The rooms were clean, the showers hot and powerful and the setting beautiful Really good for getting into the park first thing in the morning or if you want to pop back for a rest and a cold drink in the middle of the day. You are right in the middle of the jungle and we woke up to the sound of Howler monkeys. Definitely worth the slight extra expense to stay here."
40,"obviously you pay for the privilege of staying right next to the park and it's worth it, lots of fellow travellers were very jealous that we were staying there not returning to Flores or Santa Elena. It meant that we could do the sunset and sunrise tour if we liked with ease, we chose the sunset and booked this through the hotel, our guide Jose was really interesting and knowledgeable and it was a magical experience. Our room was clean and comfy, we did have a cockroach above the bed but the staff removed it when we asked! The fan kept going all night despite the fact there is no electric after certain times which was a relief. We were room 1A which seemed to be near to the generator or some noise source in the morning which was a bit of a shame as we couldn't hear the jungle"
30,Hotel is in the middle of the jungle. During the night you can hear voices from monkey and all other animals. The problem is that the place had problem with paying by credit card and have no early breakfast. But easyli you can eat oposite the hotel where local people serve delicious food. Must try. 
40,"The Jaguar Inn is very clean and comfy. The staff is very friendly. It was a bit pricey for our normally very hostel taste, but being able to hike all day around Tikal and then sleep near the jungle was priceless. The howler monkeys decided to sing us a chorus around 4 AM and it was delightful. Overall the food was pretty dang less-than-average, but the pasta was good. Of course, you're paying a bit more than you probably should because again... YOU'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF JUNGLE. Super cool.   When getting to Jaguar Inn, be super careful about who you get a ride from. Scammers galore at the airport! Shouldn't be more than 50 QUETZALS PER PERSON (each way). Make sure you hear ""QUETZALS"" as it's easy for them to ""forget"" to mention when they're talking in dollars. We almost fell for"
40,"Staying at Jaguar Hotel was expensive at $100/night but it was the best $100 room I ever stayed in. Not because it was such a great room but because of the access to Tikal that staying in the park overnight provided.  We did the sunset tour, stayed overnight, awoke to the jungle, and then roamed the ruins on our own until 8PM when our minibus picked us up and took us back to Flores. Buying park admission after 3:00 allows you to enter again the next day for free.  (Get your ticket stamped with the next day's date when you buy it in the evening though!)  By doing it this way, we saw and experienced so much more than we would have with just a sunrise or sunset tour!   I arranged everything -  a sunset tour w/ round trip transportation and the room -  from a random, small tour"
20,"The place is really nice, accommodation to fit every budget from  shared baths to private bath bungalow.  The kids enjoyed the monkeys although they were noisy, especially at 4 am.  The restaurant on site is good food but limited and pricey.  I would give them 4 stars for the hotel.  The staff however was very unhelpful with getting to see the ruins.  Every time I went to book something( 4 tries altogether) they had omitted some info.  Here is the deal, as no one explains it well  To get Into the Tikal ruins you need a ticket of Q150 per person. Kids under 12 are free.  The ruins are open from 6 to 6  There are sunset and sunrise tours with extended hours- 4 am or until 7;30 pm. For Q100 per person.  The catch is then you have to hire a guide which is $25 pp.  total rip off. "
50,"We stayed in Tikal for 2 nights. The Jungle Lodge was perfect. It was closest to the ruins entrance, was a decent price if you wanted (we are a family of 4- we got 2 of the basic rooms that had a shared washroom- it was actually awesome because the wifi reached the inside of our rooms (we had rooms E3/E4), the washrooms were a 10 second walk and always spotlessly clean- 3 private toilet/shower combos with 3 sinks outside plus more washrooms right next to that for the restaurant). The staff was excellent. Amazing customer service- kind, friendly and attentive. The food was “pricey” for Guatemalan standards, but normal restaurant prices for Canada/US. So, when you’re out of cash for the local restaurant that was cheaper and had some good food (wouldn’t recommend the chicken"
50,"Great service ,very clean room w/ tile bath , hot water, ceiling fan & a good bed, The restaurant is good w/ fair prices & good portions.The service desk arranged a pick up to Belize  which was right from the hotel , a change from a van to a tourist bus was made without any problem. The bus dropped me at the ferry terminal to Caye Caulker.With plenty of time for the boat ride."
50,"Luxurious accommodations in the cottages... indoor and outdoor shower,  soaking tub, hot tub, all in the midst of the jungle.  Lovely pool and shaded area to relax before/after time in the ruins.  If you can, go for the upscale rooms.  Electricity only a few hours a day.  Loved staying here and being so close to the ruins."
50,"I have just returned from a visit to Jungle Lodge with a group and it was fantastic. Yes it was a bit pricey as some people mentioned but it was worth it.  The food was well presented and tasty and the waiters bustled about to attend to everyone.  The rooms a luxurious (superior suites) and I had the privilege of a small troop of spider monkeys playing in the trees above.   The location cannot be beaten, you are a 2 minute walk from the entrance to Tikal (then a 45 minute walk to the first main area, or 5 minutes in the small truck operated by donations on the site).  Wifi is only available in reception and whilst the [power is on, but (certainly in my group's rooms) we had a fan all night and at least 2 electrical outlets to charge cameras, tablets, etc.  I will gladly return"
40,"The hotel is ok, not great. They close electricity at 10pm and it only lasts every day for a couple of hours. Also they serve dinner until 8:30pm, we came in a bit later and missed dinner. Other then this the rooms are ok, simple and functional. Outside there is a nice pool and the garden looks great. I would go there only for one night to see Tikal at sunrise other wise would stay in Flores."
30,"I've stayed here twice, once in 1999 and now in 2016.  The rooms, the food, etc. haven't really changed since 1999.  The pool looks better now.  The breakfast is better than the dinner (or at least what I picked, the steak with garlic sauce, skip it.  The steak was overcooked, tough and tasted like it had Italian salad dressing all over it).  The best reason to stay here is to do the Sunrise tour.  It is a great experience.  A must do."
40,"The cabanas are nice with comfortable beds and pool.  In the park and short walk to the site. No electricity after about 9pm so take a battery powered fan and light with you. Breakfast is good with fresh melon and eggs but the dinner menu is restricted and the food is not good.  We booked a day tour to the ruins of Uaxactun which are interesting but the guide, Elias (probably spelled his name wrong and mispronounced it) was not good.  Only go with him if you want to watch him watch birds.  This was our second time at the Inn, our first visit 6 years ago was much better."
30,"Great location in the park allows multiple visits to the ruins and the surrounding forest. Nice rooms and a pool are the positives, neutral staff, poor WiFi, a limited restaurant menu, no power during the day or after 10pm (this is common throughout the hotels in Tikal) the negatives. Suggest you stay in Tikal but perhaps the Jaguar Inn is a better option."
50,"We stayed for two nights and had an amazing experience!!  This Inn FAR exceeded my expectations.  Rooms were clean and nice.  Tour guides for both the sunset and sunrise tours were fantastic!  The pool was the best way to cool off after exploring the ruins.  A very, very wonderful stay!"
30,The hotel is basic but fine. The area is breathtaking. Food is basic. Service is basic. Internet and lights go out at 9 or 10 pm so be ready. The weather is surprisingly temperate and. Bug free this time of year. Don't miss the sunrise or sunset from the top of the highest temple. 
30,"We absolutely loved Tikal, and are glad we stayed the night: it was very special to take the sunset tour and walk through a dark jungle back to our room. And even the early morning walk is beautiful: you get to hear the jungle come alive with all the birds and the howler monkeys welcoming the sun. The Jaguar Inn itself, we felt was fine, but could be much better, especially for the price. It's comfy, safe, and clean, but lacks a few extra touches. For instance, there is nobody at the desk early mornings, so if you have to leave at 6am (in order to catch the flight that leaves Flores at 8am), you have to not only check out the night before and arrange your transport then, but also hope that there is no real emergency (like the transport not showing up). There is no cell network"
40,"If you want to stay in the park, your options are limited.  The prices here were on the steep side, but it is a truly one-of-a-kind experience.  If you want to open your room's door to lizards, monkeys in the trees, and pizotes lazily passing by, you should definitely stay here!  It is also a great place to stay if you want to do a sunrise tour of the ruins, as this hotel is about as close as it gets to the ruins themselves.  At night you can hear the howler monkeys talking too!  The staff here was very friendly and accommodating, and the food was delicious!    The rooms are very basic, though clean, and the wifi is very questionable, but you are in the jungle next to ruins, after all, so what you lack in technological access, you make up for in outdoor experiences."
40,"When we added Tikal to our must see list in Guatemala, we looked for lodging options within the park. Jaguar Inn is conveniently located next to the gates to the park. The staff was very accommodating and assisted us in booking the sunrise and sunset tours. The prices are a bit on the high side for Guatemala, however the convenience justified the cost. The food is of good quality and quantity. The rooms have all the basic necessities. The internet is unreliable and only available in the restaurant and outdoor patio areas. We had a pleasant two night stay."
40,"Spending the night in Tikal was priceless, you can access the park to see the dawn and the sunset when there are very few people visiting and the heat and humidity are still manageable. The most impressive aspect was the forest noises, howler monkeys in particular, and a powerful night storm, priceless experience. The moskitos were fierce so repellent is well advised. The cost of the room although much higher than in other parts of Guatemala was well worth it. The restaurant pricey but good standard, the staff very friendly, would recommend."
50,"The best place to stay to visit Tikal, but keep in mind that this place is IN THE JUNGLE.  Electricity is only turned on for certain hours, there are bugs and there will be monkeys swinging in the trees above your villa (which is amazing!).  The lodge is inside the park, so it offers an opportunity to take the night tours of Tikal…which we would highly recommend :)  The rooms were comfortable and perfect for a 2 night stay to visit Tikal. Definitely take and use mosquito repellant, as they will get through the mosquito net during the night."
50,"We stayed at the Jungle Lodge as part of the PACZ tours package, from San Ignacio, Belize. The hotel is a nice place in the middle of the jungle, just a short walk from the ruins of Tikal.   The room was clean, with mosquito netting surrounding the bed, and screens on the windows. No actual windows. The ceiling fan kept things cool, however you definitely notice the dampness of the jungle without AC. This is a very nice hotel located in the middle of nowhere. The power shuts off around 11 PM until 6 in the morning or so, so have headlamps ready. Rooms do not have WIFI and there is no cell service in Tikal (except on the tops of the pyramids). There is WIFI in the lobby and at the pool, but we couldn't get it to connect. This is the jungle, go enjoy the wood-wide web instead of"
50,"I was visiting Tikal on my way to Belize so I didn't want to backtrack back into Flores, Guatemala  (where all the tour buses take you). I decided to stay in Tikal's Jungle Lodge and leave early in the morning for Belize. Very good decision!  The hotel was great and the staff were very helpful in arranging my early morning transport towards the Belize Border.   If you need somewhere to stay in the park, I recommend this hotel and their helpful staff!"
40,Amazing location right in the heart of her jungle. It was raining a lot when I was there and was very humid so everything felt a bit damp. Full Electricity was only available during certain hours of the day  but you always have a Light and a plug available. Don’t rely on on the internet as it is satellite based sonic the weather is bad it won’t work properly. The rooms were beautiful though and location is amazing. Absolutely loved it.
40,"Jungle Lodge is situated just a short walk from the ancient city of Tikal.  It has by far the best location in Tikal National Park.  The rooms are very spacious and luxurious and surrounded by beautiful tropical plants.  Be forewarned that since the resort relies on a generator for power, there are certain hours when there is no electricity, although the ceiling fan works all the time.  There is no air conditioning.  One disappointment was the food, which was very average.  The menu is clearly trying to appeal to European tastes, but I would have been happier if it included more local dishes.  That being said, the wait staff was extremely friendly and helpful."
50,"Stayed here for one night while visiting Tikal.  Really liked it.  Right beside gates to Tikal, serves good breakfast lunch and dinner options at reasonable prices (breakfast wasn't included for us),  large room (no aircon but really good fan helps alot with the heat and humidity) good shower (even though we were told it was hot between 6-9 morning an evening we found was often hot outside of these times and in the heat of Tikal you often only want a cool shower anyway)  wifi only in reception/restaurant area, manager at reception was very helpful.  We found it more enjoyable to explore Tikal without a guide.  The first day we did this with our lonely planet and it was nice exploring in the quiet on our own.  We signed up for the sunrise tour through the hotel the following"
40,"Since the hotel is situated in the national park, just a short walk from the entrance to the ruins, it's very convenient for a early morning visit to the Tikal ruins site. For this reason worth the extra costs compared to staying in Flores. Plus you get a little bit of jungle feel. The hotel is pleasant with all basic conveniences, good for a night or two. No telephone coverage; you have to use the hotel satellite phone if you want to make a phone call, which is expensive. Internet connection unstable."
50,Tikal is amazing.  It is defiantly worth it to stay the night.  It is the closest hotel to the entrance.  The restaurant is good and the people are very helpful.   Wildlife was everywhere.  Woke up to howler monkeys!
40,"The hotel is in the jungle near to tikal attractions. The rooms are big and cozy. During the night, the jungle comes alive. You can hear lots of voices but if you are tired you sleep easily. In the early morning you can eat outside the hotel from the local people. They have great local food."
30,"Pretty amazing to be able to stay within the jungle for this experience!!  It was incredible but you have to know that your clothes will not dry out, there is no AC, you must have bug spray...which is nothing to say about the Jaguar Inn only the location.    Their staff was WONDERFUL!!"
50,"The most important thing to understand about the hotel is its location. It is only a few minutes walk to Tikal National Park so it allows you to enter the park with a guide before it is open to the general public. This means you can see the park and the wildlife in the quiet of the morning and evening when they are at their most active times. This is an enchanting experience.  The hotel itself is comfortable with clean, large rooms. Because it is in such an isolated spot everything needs to be transported to the hotel from the nearest city. This means that electricity and hot water is only available during certain hours, that the menu is not as extensive as in a city based location and sometimes the wi-fi reception is poor.  However, this is made up for by the beautiful"
40,"We chose to stay here as part of our vacation. The room was very clean and the service was excellent in the restaurant and front desk. The grounds were well cared for. Didn't use the pool but looked very inviting. I liked being close to the park. Only things I would improve on would be to have internet in the rooms and not just in the lobby. Also, I would put information cards in each room telling hours of meals, pool, hours of electricity, etc. other than that very enjoyable stay."
50,"In february we had the pleasure of staying at the Tikal Inn. Our bungalow was comfortable, our meals were tasty and the staff very helpful. The tour guide was knowledgeable and interesting. We did hire Roxy, an archeologist for another tour, we were enthralled. If you are looking to ""stay connected"", television, etc, this is not the hotel for you. If you enjoy listening to the wildlife, birds,  hiking in the jungle and exploring this  fantastic archeological sites, this is the hotel for you! We stayed 3 nights, a highlight in Guatemala."
30,"Stayed here for one night in January. Our room was very far from the main building and it was very basic. You are in the middle of the jungle so we weren't expecting much, but the bed was not the most comfortable and the showers weren't very good at all. The food was very plain but the service was excellent. it was an amazing experience being in the jungle and within walking distance to Tikal. Didn't use the pool but it looked nice. Wifi was very poor but chances are you won't have much time to use it!"
40,"We choose Tikal Inn to visit the ruins because of the great location. Literally walk out of your hotel and you're almost at the ruins entrance. Which is perfect so you can go out for dawn and dusk, avoiding the heat and crowds.   There are only a couple of hotels in the Tikal reserve so book well in advance. The price was fine considering the location and it has an amazing huge pool!! Which was so welcome as it was really hot and humid whilst we were there.  We had a cheaper double room with ensuite that didn't face the garden. It was very large and perfectly adequate. It was also right by the garden so we could walk out to the pool easily. The wifi was a bit useless if it was hot for some reason, but apparently early morning and late at night it worked ok. Only in the lobby and"
50,"1st time at Tikal and Jungle Lodge, but will not be the last!  This hotel exceeded our expectations.  We checked in at around 8pm and they immediately offered to extend full power to 11pm to allow us time to have dinner, and get settled.  Very impressed with customer service.  When we asked about coffee for the sunrise tour they offered to have a carafe on the table in the lobby for us.  The bungalow had 2 queen sized beds and mosquito netting. a nice bathroom with tiled shower, and porch with a couple of chairs.  And the ceiling fan could run all night as well as one double outlet which powered by husband’s CPAP machine all night.  As mentioned in other reviews, this hotel is right at the entrance to the ruins and the closest one.  This makes it easier for the sunrise tour,"
50,"The best hotel actually inside the national park at Tikal. Great pool which means you can do sunrise, only have to get up at 4.30 and then have a rest at midday before doing more of the site and sunset. Cabins mostly located in the grounds - quiet and separated from each other.   Very helpful hotel with cabins, stay in the garden rooms, although could improve by serving coffee at 4am for those going out for sunrise.  Restaurant OK but worth trying the competition if you stay more than one night - worth doing for a very relaxing way to see Tikal and then travel to/from Flores in the daylight. Transfers booked through the hotel are more expensive than those that can be easily arranged in Flores- no real benefit. The hotel is right by the entrance to the site and you can easily"
40,"Stayed for two nights at the Jungle Lodge Hotel/Hostal. We really enjoyed our time there as you're right in the jungle and at night you can hear all the animals which is a cool experience. You're really paying for the jungle experience as the room we stayed in was bit on the expensive side for a ""hostal"" room with no shared location to make food. Bathrooms were very nice on the other hand. Keep in mind you will need to bring food that is simple and does not need to be refrigerated to save money if need be. The only other option is buying at their restaurant (moderately priced, decent food) or the Comedors down the road. It was a huge bonus to stay at the park for at least one night to experience either the sunset or sunrise, and then have time to wander the grounds during the"
50,"Staff was incredibly giving, open and welcoming. Room was comfortable and faculties were so clean. Dinner was good and decently priced! Perfect walking distance for Tikal! Went with a few friends and Absolutely loved it!"
50,"We only spent 1 night at the Jungle Lodge in the rooms with shared baths.  The room was larger than we thought and the bathroom/shower areas were excellent.  For being in the middle of a jungle, we felt spoiled and rewarded for staying the night.  The restaurant was quite good as well and the service throughout was excellent.  A good experience and glad we did it.  And, the whole experience was reasonably priced including the price of a cold beer in the park after walking for hours."
40,"Our stay at Jaguar Inn (end of May) was outstanding. It was clean, quiet and extremely relaxing. We were coming from a place where we were very catered to and almost 'expected' to order afternoon drinks, etc. It was wonderful to be in a place where we were free from that. At night we sat outside on the patio, read, and watched fireflies. The mosquitoes were, amazingly, not a problem which was surprising because we were bothered by them walking through the jungle path in Tikal itself. Tikal is an immense place to explore and take in. It is also draining because of the heat. So, we spend about 4 hours there on the day we arrived and 3 hours the next morning. Jaguar in is just across from the entrance to Tikal. The restaurant was good and the staff very helpful. It was a great way"
50,"It was really great staying at the park.  The hotel price was good and the quality of the room was nice.  I booked on line and realized I made a mistake with the date.  I thought I might have to pay a cancellation fee and rebook.  But I e-mailed them and they were so good about rebooking since there was an opening on the ""real"" date I needed the room.  I appreciated them being fair. I thought the hotel staff was friendly, and again it's just special staying at the park!"
50,"We stayed 2 nights here to tour the ruins.  We arrived late our first night but one of the employees waited for us so we could check-in!  We were so worried because our shuttle had arrived late but the employees were kind enough to wait for us.  Our room was super clean! The food was delicious! Everyone was super helpful and I appreciated the manager, Carlos, for giving me great tips on what temples to see and other great advice.  Overall, my wife and I had such a wonderful experience in this beautiful area."
40,"We enjoyed our stay right there in amazing Tikal.  The rooms were clean and the staff was very friendly.  However, dinner prices were quite high.  Folks on a budget will enjoy a great meal at one of two delicious local restaurants across the parking lot near the museum. Also, although the staff was so friendly, they never had any cash to help with money exchanges. This is a standard service most hotels should provide.  And lastly, there as an excess of bugs biting us inside our room... the screens could perhaps use some repair.  All things considered though, it was good."
50,"We stayed 2 nights to explore the park. The rooms were sparkling clean and we didn't notice the power outages at all. The restaurant was serviceable and the people helpful. We booked a night time excursion and the guide, Noah was fabulous. We ""paid"" extra to stay in the park after closing and climbed the top of a temple to see the sunset. Then, Noah took us on a nighttime jungle hike. We were the only ones there and laid in the grass looking at the stars in the grand plaza. It was a one of a kind experience. I would highly recommend this hotel!"
50,"Better not expect luxury in the heart of the guatemalan jungle. The hotel is unique and provides great conditions to feel that you're out of reach - no mobile phones connection, even wi-fi does not always work properly. But you're in a jungle. Benefit from that. The rooms are big, not closed - higher parts of the walls are open, but anti-moskitos. No aircondition. It's great to feel the nature and wilderness. Electricity works only few hours in the morning and evening. Hotel offers big pool and restaurant. It's in walking distance from the main entrance to the ruins and comedores - places to eat. Great adventure to stay there if you're only open-minded."
20,I thought the room wasn't terribly clean; the shower barely worked; the swimming pool was filthy and filled with mosquitos; the food at the hotel was really boring and came in small portions; and the perk of staying nearby the park wasn't worth it...as the hotel only offers a sunrise hike that starts way too early in the morning and apparently had been cloudy/foggy for a week straight.  The hotel was overpriced for what it was.
30,"If I had to do this trip over again, I would have stayed in Flores and done day trips.  For me, it was just too hot to stay here - electricity is limited to a few hours a day and I would just prefer to stay somewhere that at least has a functioning ceiling fan at night.  Room was ok, nothing special.  Food was mediocre but edible.  Front desk seemed confused and did not give out accurate info.    Wifi was almost nonexistent but this is a jungle so I don't expect much wifi.  One neat aspect was listening to the sounds of the jungle during the night.  And, of course, being able to go to Tikal when it wasn't crowded."
30,"My rating should translate to good (between average and very good). We stayed here for one night so we could see the park early in the morning and ;ate in the evening without the bus crowd. The ground s were well kept, the rooms very clean. The swimming pool was a pretty place to cool down after hiking in the jungle heat. The included breakfast included eggs (think protein) and fruit as well as bread and beans. This gave us sustained energy for the morning hike. The recent robberies on the road to the park appear to be of tour busses, we had no trouble in our private car. Another reason to stay in the park!"
30,"I don't recommend this hotel to stay for more than 1 night. My girlfriend and I se te there for 2 days - 1 night to experience the sunrise on the top of the Temple IV inside Tikal national park. Three main reasons why I don't recommend this hotel:  1. Shuttle service from Flores/Santa Elena is a mess, it took around 2 hours and 3 round trips to santa elena for the bus driver to start heading to the hotel (2hours approx)  2. Food at the restaurant is super expensive and not that good. At the time of arrival we were starving, so we ordered breakfast. After 10 minutes we were told that breakfast time was done and only some crappy snacks were available ...0% customer experience...   3. Wifi Internet is the worst you can find! Not even in the lobby or commun areas. So if your main"
40,Private bungalows within landscaped jungle gardens and a central area where you can get good a la carte food in a cavernous dining room. There are themed Mayan animal print murals all around but there is nothing cosy about the place. It is not for honeymooners as there is only mosquito net between you and your neighbours! Best bit - a lovely pool to swim in after the exertions of sight seeing around the vast Tikal complex. Not a huge pool but big enough to do a few strokes across. Lounge by it surrounding by monkeys and birds in the trees.
40,The Jungle Lodge Tical was just as advertised - a jungle lodge. The cabin was small but adequate and clean. The Lodge itself was just as one would expect - an open air old fashion (but very nice) lodge. The food was good and the service was excellent and you cannot beat the location.  We had the added experience of an howler monkey serenade one evening.  Highly recommended!
40,"We wanted to stay inside Tikal to be able to access the site for sunset and the jungle Lodge seemed to be the most cost effective option.  We stayed in the standard room (bit spartan but ok for one night) with the shared bathrooms which look like they been recently updated.  There was alot of work going on in reception so it looks like there is an upgrade in process.  The pool was lovely, the food and restaurant a bit average but ok.  You can pay on credit card which is helpful, wifi is advertised but painful and flaky - just enjoy the time being off radar.  The hotel will offer transport & guiding services but at a cost - we sorted our transport via the information point (very visible near the Commedor Tikal) and expect you could have got a guide from there as well."
40,"This is a series of duplex 'lodges. The power turns off at 10pm. You are in the jungle. The hotel seems solar powered so the hot water in our room was tepid, at best. The grounds are lovely and safe. The staff is just excellent. The best part is not having to drive the 1hour to Flores. You pay more... But you are right there in the park. (Think Yosemite Lodge or Crater Lake Lodge) I highly recommend bringing your own booze and food as both are expensive there. Plus the food is cafeteria grade school quality. Not very good. The guide, Antonio, is a staff person at the lodge. We took the dawn tour and he was perfect, fun, happy, knowledgeable. Again, just drive by and ignore the guides back out at the park entrance, 17 miles away. Cough up the dough. These folks know what they are"
50,"We were excited to stay at the Jungle Lodge.  We wanted to experience the Jungle instead of rushing in/out of Flores.  Like most other reviews, there isn't much to do at night here, but we enjoyed being in the park until late. The desk staff were helpful but got a little frustrated with us as we were deciding what to do about hiring a guide. They were nice enough to watch our backpacks until we could check in.  Our reservation said 2 adults so we were charged more for having 4 even though two beds were enough for the four of us.  The facility is beautiful.  The rooms are nice and well decorated. The pool area is gorgeous and we were sad that it was raining.  The power cuts out from 10pm-6am but the main light in the room still works even when the power is cut out.  We ate"
40,"Jaguar Inn is right at the entrance to Tikal. We decided it was ok to pay a little extra for the ideal location. Very nice property, beautiful garden and well kept rooms with nice furniture. Some food was great, some ok. Sunrise tour was amazing. Pretty much need to stay at the hotel to participate. Make sure you organize transportation to and from Tikal before going. Little trouble with the front desk but nothing serious. Overall a great stay and worth it."
40,"We rented 2 rooms. I was okay with not having electricity for certain things for a few hours during the night even though everyone else on our trip complained everything else was great except .... in our room:   we found roaches in our room and the water temperature was extremely difficult to adjust our other room:   smelled like unbearable gutter throughout the whole stay and was not very clean. I left a note about our complaints but I never received feedback. Other than that, the workers were knowledgeable and extremely nice and the kids just loooooved staying ""in the jungle"""
40,"Jaguar Inn, as well as being very close to the entrance to the part of Tikal only accessible during the day, is within the larger park area. Being in the jungle there is a lot of wildlife close to hand - particularly birds. We were a party of four and the only visitors to the Jaguar Inn on the two nights we stayed. Even so, the kitchens were open with a range of dishes at a reasonable cost - given the locality. The bar/restaurant shuts at 9pm when the electricity is turned off for conservation reasons. We took an early morning birdwatching tour which was arranged for us by the hotel and which got us into the park earlier than normal opening hours. If you are staying at the Inn to visit Tikal the following day, by arriving at/after 3pm your park entry fee will cover you for the"
30,"The hotel is a walking distance from the entrance to the Tikal park. It has the charm of being in the middle of the jungle, along with the logical limitations which make it interesting as well. However, there is a lot of room for improvement. The food is not good, much better and cheaper are the eateries surrounding the inn. i could never take a hot shower in the allowed time slot and most importantly the facility needs to be updated. Nicer bed spreads, furniture, painting of the rooms and curtains can go a long way!!! Having said this, the drivers and guides offered through the inn are excellent and better priced than others. So, a little bit of everything as it should be expected. The beauty of the park and the area makes it worth it. Don't forget to go to Flores!"
40,Beautiful grounds. Very helpful staff. My husband had an allergic reaction to the honey and one of the waiters went with us to the clinic as interpreter. Food was very good in the restaurant and portions were generous. Go on the sunrise and sunset tours.  Ask for Caesar as your guide. Great experience.  Rooms are clean and comfortable.
30,"First impression pushy front desk recommending meal plans & tours. Breakfast one is fine forget the dinner one limited choice and the resturaunt  has a  large  menu food was fine and the service . Power goes out at 10pm means no fan at night makes it little warm or stuffy but one is in the jungle after all.  WIFI not the best spotty could only receive one night not send , yet worked in the morning. Nice pool for a swim after a  day walking around the park. The big advantage  is staying near the park early access better pictures fewer people.  "
40,"First off you have to realize where you are and expectations should be formed accordingly. The room was clean and functional, everyone seemed to be enjoying the swimming pool, the food was very good and well priced, and the staff very friendly and helpful. Being right at the entrance to the park was great, and there are some trails nearby if you want to go out on your own for at least a little ways. To me the best part was the howler monkeys in the nearby trees and beautiful turkeys wandering around. This is not a five star property, really not even a four star, but considering where you are, it is a good place to stay."
40,The Inn is typical of National Parks with limited amenities. We were there for only 1 night and arranged an afternoon tour of the ruins with the hotel which also included dinner and breakfast for $25us per person.  Our guide was Andreas and he was marvelous. All and all a great experience and I recommend a visit.
50,"I was here for a 1 night stay at the end of my 1 wk trip to Guatemala. My hotel package included 2 meals and a sunset tour and I had also pre-arranged a tour with Roxy (archeologist/hotel mgr) the next morning. Unfortunately, I started to feel unwell with vague sx the morning of the trip (before I even arrived - attributed to lack of sleep). By the time of the Sunset tour, I was just feeling really drained, but I didn't want to miss out. Edgar, our tour guide, was very professional, fun,and knowledgeable. He had the hotel bar fix me a lemon drink w/ salt to help me w/ electrolyte repletion at the end of the tour since I was starting to feel dehydrated (during the tour, I could only take a few sips of water before feeling full). Well, that night, my symptoms finally came full"
50,"Staff were helpful and informed.  Kudos to Roxy Ortiz and to Elias S. for their birdwatching collegiality and their broad knowledge of local, regional, and national issues of environmental conservation, archaeological preservation, and global awareness.  Both are dedicated professionals in their fields and great assets to the Tikal park and community. Hotel was as expected: local inn, thatched roof and open-air, gracious basics without frills.  Food and service were good; the location is isolated and they prepare/bake everything on site, with both potable and not-potable water trucked in.  Location in the park is a huge benefit for early-morning and dusk experience.  Birding is great.  The ruins are, needless to say, world-class and magnificent."
50,"My expectations were not high, probably based in part on outdated information but also on the fact that given the great location, the hotel doesn't have to be top notch.  My son's and my room was comfortable and quite presentable in all respects -- though certainly not luxurious.  The common areas are very nice -- in significant part because of recent renovations, which are well done.  We (and our guide) had one dinner and one breakfast, and all six meals were good.  I my return to Tikal later this year with my wife, who is more picky than I am, and I would stay (and eat) at the Jungle Lodge without hesitation."
20,"The good: nice rooms, staff that try real hard The bad: The food is awful, management could careless about addressing an issue...they have your money and don’t care. Wifi is only in reception, and power is only during certain times...the last two is manageable / fun... but the food really is bad."
50,"As others have emphasised, the great advantage of the Jungle Lodge is its location - a very short walk from the entrance into the archaeological site of Tikal itself.  That being said, the hotel is very pleasant.  I understand that it has recently been refurbished and upgraded, so perhaps the older reviews are no longer strictly applicable.  We did not encounter Carlos (see older reviews)!  We stayed two nights in a junior suite with a king-size bed in a semi-detached cabina.  The bed did have a mosquito net of sorts, but it would not have kept out many mosquitoes.  It seemed just a token gesture.  But there were not any mosquitoes there when we stayed, it was too cold for them.  The bathroom was pleasant enough, though we could not get any hot water out of the shower on one"
40,"Rooms are fine. Restaurant  is ok. Wifi did not work. Nor did data. Service is pretty good. But location is the selling point. And Tony the guide. Book him. He knows archaeology, history, Mayan culture, botany, politics , birds engineering. Superb"
50,We arrived at 9pm due to a delayed flight and were served dinner promptly. We were pleasantly surprised to discover that all the rooms had been recently renovated and are immaculate. There are one or two snagging problems but they'll get ironed out. Brilliant to be right next to the archaeological site as you need two goes at it. We entered on two consecutive days and felt we'd seen it throughly. You can be woken at 0515 by over-excited howler monkeys which makes you feel you're really in the rain forest. During our recent visit the hotel still hadn't finished renovating all the public rooms but that was no big deal. Wifi patchy - you're in the middle of a national park so deal with it! If being out of 24 hour contact is a problem it's best not to come. We had as much
40,"We shared a quad room which made it affordable, room was lovely and clean, staff very helpful. Great restaurant, especially breakfast after the sunrise tour, on the expensive side but to be expected in a national park, we brought snacks, beers and a gallon of drinking water to save on money. No pool but we went to Tikal Inn for lunch and used their pool which was great in the heat of the day. Take lots of hard core repelant and keep reapplying - we were absolutely eaten by all sorts other than mosquitos (even though we kept reapplying)"
30,"We stayed at Jaguar Inn in August 2014. As one of only three places to stay in Tikal park, this hotel is fine. The prices for all three hotels are inflated and compared to the rest of Central America you don't really get your money's worth. That being said, the room was large and the bed was comfortable. The service in the restaurant was great, our server was very friendly and even made us special watermelon margaritas that were super tasty.  Our room was clean although we did find a scorpion in the curtains, and there were definitely a lot of bugs in the room. Luckily we had brought a mosquito net with us.  All in all, it is a decent place to stay if you want to be in the park. Just don't expect that the relatively high cost of the rooms means the rooms are high quality - they"
40,"Staying just outside the gates to Tikal was an incredible advantage.  We were able to start early at dawn in the ruins, take afternoon breaks in our room, and head back out on the trails in the afternoon.  The hotel has a very good, reasonably priced restaurant where we took all our meals.  The staff was friendly and efficient.  Our room was adequate and comfortable, offering a place for us to dry out and sit on our own porch during the rainy times during our visit.  We are birders and saw many in the garden just outside our room.  The place is not fancy but we highly recommend it to others."
40,"I knew when I saw the hammock on my bugalow's front porch that this was going to be a good place to stay. The room was clean and comfortable, and the lack of a/c was not a problem. I appreciate when a hotel works within the infrastructure limitations of the area rather than developing in an unsustainable fashion. The staff and management were fantastic, made sure I had transport to and from the airport, answered all my questions, and really made my brief trip everything I wanted it to be. They also arranged my hotel in Flores and the same driver took me there and then to catch my plane the next day. The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars was the food. There wasn't really anything wrong with it, it just falls into the category I call ""sanitized tourist."" I understand that not"
50,We stayed at the location outside of Tikal.  It was actually perfect and after going to the location in the park I was pleased with our choice to stay outside of Tikal - we like to move around a bit!  I would highly recommend this location!  Thanks.
50,"Being able to stay within the national Park is amazing !!! Location is very close to the entry way to the park. Restaurant on site, pool on site, manicured grounds. Because it is an ecological park - they supply their own electricity - a few hours in the morning and a few hours in the evening.  Battery and wall mounted light in every room. I highly recommend a headlamp and portable flash lights. Seeing monkeys in the trees is common. They even have an out door netted room with hammocks for you to use. The personnel on site were extremely helpful and accommodating. Food was excellent for the few days we were there. I highly recommend this place if you are going to be there overnight - it allows you to spend a longer day at the park - it easily takes the entire day to check out"
40,"We stayed at the Tikal Inn for 3 nights in February this year. We chose this Inn for it's proximity to the archaeological site and also for its location in the jungle. We were not disappointed! The accommodation is fairly basic but clean and comfortable. The food is simple but well cooked, very nicely presented and tasty. The staff were all extremely nice and helpful. The grounds are attractive and the pool is especially nice. We really liked the location of our garden room, and loved being surrounded by the sounds of the jungle. We must make a special mention of Roxy, who works with the hotel and takes guests on guided tours of the archaeological site. Roxy is an archaeologist and you cannot do better than have her guide you through the amazing site of Tikal. She is equally"
50,"My husband and I stayed in Hotel Tikal Inn for 2 nights in March, 2016.  Our room was bright and airy, the pool and garden were lovely, the staff was very cordial and very helpful, and the food was good. The premises were immaculately clean and the grounds perfectly maintained.  After 2 full days exploring the incredible ruins at Tikal, just a few steps away from the hotel, we spent the last afternoon swimming in the pool and waiting for our shuttle back to the airport.  The whole experience was wonderful."
50,"This is a very nice and quiet inn. One word tranquility. The power if I remember goes off at 8:00pm. Not to worry after your tour of the park the day is full and you really want to rest. There is an outdoor pool , relaxing. Sit back relax and enjoy the view! I actually visited in December 2008 or 2009"
10,"We wanted to like this hotel because it seemed to have a great pool and was on the grounds of the park.   Let's start with the pushy sales pitch at check in. They want you to buy a package with tours and food, which isn't a good deal because the restaurant sucks. You have like four options (the same four options every day) and none of them are good. The Wi-Fi that they advertise is unreliable at best, there's only electricity for a few hours a day, and the tap water on site isnt spectacular. On top of that, the staff wasn't particularly helpful nor friendly.   If we ever decide to go back to Tikal, we will NOT be staying here."
40,"We booked a bungalow here for two nights to enjoy everything that Tikal has to offer.  As noted by other reviewers the location is perfect, no other resort is this close to the park and its entry.   Our bungalow was gorgeous, beautiful bathroom overlooking the jungle with Loccitane products, nice splashes of teal and wallpaper with monkeys on it. The main front of house building is currently being renovated. The wifi is weak,  lighting poor and the dining room cavernous, not a place to hang out in. We were given information when we arrived regarding meal and generator times but the latter didnt have much impact on us. The main lamp in the bedroom was on a standby system and could be switched on anytime.  The staff are great and food comes out of the kitchen quite quickly for"
40,"A good place to relax after hiking and climbing the Mayan ruins of Tikal. The pool is very cold, beyond refreshing with a poolside bar. In the lodge is a good restaurant to rest and recharge before continuing the adventure "
50,"The Jungle Lodge was a bit of a wonderful surprise for us.  The rooms were very nice.   We booked two premium rooms, and for one we were given an upgrade to a junior suite. We were only there one night and wish we had stayed longer.  Location could not be better.  Easy walk to the ruins.  Best to see the ruins early morning or late in the day and best to stay at one of the three hotels in the park to do this.  The accommodations were lovely.  Beds very comfortable, all clean and well maintained.  The junior suite had a beautiful bathroom.  Staff were polite and attentive.   Others have mentioned the limited electricity hours.  The hotel has a generator so even during the ""off"" hours, there is an outlet working to charge your phone & an overhead light.  Wifi is limited to the"
50,"This hotel seemed to be the best place to book based on TripAdvisor reviews and it didn't disappoint. We received airport pickup ($20 one way, $30 round trip/pp) and were met by our driver holding our name card. We arrived very early and our rooms were not ready until 2pm. So we ate breakfast (decent menu selections) and hung out at the pool until our rooms were ready. The rooms are pretty standard with mosquito nets for each bed. The bathroom was very modern and in our bungalow, we even had a Jacuzzi tub. From our bungalow, we could hear and see a lot of howler monkeys. It really felt like we were in the middle of a jungle.  A few things to note - check in process was very very slow and English is hardly spoken. Also, they made us pay for the entire stay upon check in which we"
40,We stayed there 2 nights for our trips to Tikal and Ambergris Caye. The hotel is very nice with all the plants around the rooms and the walk ways. It was nice to have the swimming pool but we didn't use it.  We got the room with 2 double beds. The room is nice and clean . There was no internet in the room.  The foods in the restaurant are so so . We went to the restaurant at the Jaguar Inn to eat on the last night. The foods there is better and cheaper.
40,Excellent location. Rooms comfortable but warm as there is no air conditioning and the fan goes off at about 9 or 10. Food good. personnel very accomodating. Management well done. Pricing very modest. Clean. Close to the Tikal ruins. Excellent choice.
40,"This has the best price of the 3 hotels at Tikal. We come to Tikal often and stay for 2 to 4 nights so we can enjoy the ruins and the jungle / animals / birds.These come right into the garden. Jaguar Inn has good rooms and is quiet. The restaurant is okay but menu is limited so we take some meals here and some next-door at Tikal Inn where we also use their pool if we go for lunch. Beware of biting insects around pool. The only negative of Jaguar Inn is that we can't always get a reservation and on one occasion they had given our reservation away to a group. So, show up early and/ or be prepared to spend first night at one of the other hotels and pay more. They also have tents at Jaguar Inn if you want to hear more of the jungle sounds."
20,"The rooms were not bad but the only being able to have a hot water early in the morning to have a shower is ridiculous.  Especially after a day of walking around in the humidity, baking hot sun, pouring rain and mud, you are going to want to clean up a bit!  We were there for Christmas Eve and Day dinner and the food was poor.  Cold buffet turkey on Christmas Day for that amount of money?  Not to mention that the price to get into the park only includes one entrance into the Mayan ruins.  If you want to go back again the next day, you have to pay again even though you are staying inside the park!  The ruins are worth it  but stay some where else (stay in town and see the ruins in one day) if you are planning to stay over night."
40,"The hotel was very clean even including the smallish rooms, but they where good place to get some sleep and a shower after a hot day in the ruins. There was no air conditioning but the fans seem to keep the room quite comfortable at night to sleep. They said there was only hot water 6-9 am/pm but we know that was not the case. We where also told we could go to the other 2 hotels to use the pool but that was also not the case. If you ahve to hang around waiting for ride book the other hotel for the pool. Morning breakfast was an adventure as every morning a Coati ( looked like cross between a raccoon and an ant eater ) came hoping on tables looking to get his nose in the sugar jars, no fear of us. Now if you book a trip with a guide please be aware of the extra costs. The hotels"
50,"We stopped here one night. We booked ahead the sunset and sunrise tour for discounted price. We had our private tour guide, who explained us everything of Tikal and the Maya's. The room was spacious, clean and tidy. The power and wifi shut off round about 9 pm. That's through the location. There is onside restaurant, where you can have breakfast, lunch and dinner. All tasty. We really enjoyed ourselves there and was a nice expierience."
40,"This Inn is surrounded by the jungle and you get the full jungle experience! You'll hear howler monkeys, owls, hawks and other exotic jungle animals! We stayed in one of their  bungalows and we almost felt like Tarzan and Jane! There are no windows just screens so your human neighbors can sometime over power the sound of nature. The inn also has a really nice 6' pool and the water is relatively warm. You can swim till 9pm, that is before they shut down power for the entire night! No electricity from 9pm to 6am! Situated very conveniently for tikal hikes...you're inside the National Park. Pass on the food, we felt Jaguar inn served tastier meals! Overall, nice jungle lodge! Worth the inexpensive $$. "
30,"I loved being able to stay in the park and would absolutely recommend a one or two night stay here on that basis. I took full advantage by doing a tour, an early morning sunrise trip and then spending another full day wandering by myself. I wouldn't have been able to do all of this without being right there.  That said, the hotel is quite basic although clean and the pool area is lovely (can get loud though!). The food on offer is fine, but nothing special. Service is generally good, but there were a few things that let it down for me. Firstly, we had a poor guide on the sunrise tour and after feeding this back to the hotel (it was arranged through them) it was clear they were uninterested. Secondly, I purchased some water from the bar after a long day out walking and before"
40,"Overall the hotel is ok.  Staff was polite but not super nice.  The check out listed on the room door and what we were told was incorrect so we were abruptly kicked out upon check out.  Not fun for a 25 week pregnant woman who was resting.  They also made it seem that in order to do the sunrise tour we had to have a guide.  What we later learned is that no guide is needed.  You can show up to the gate and just pay the early entrance fee, which you have to pay anyway, guide or not.  I hate guided tours and we felt tricked.    The food was meh, but the pool, ohhhhhhhhhhhh the pool!!!!  Swimming in the late afternoon while the howler monkeys talk with parrots flying by might be one of my favorite memories ever.  The outdoor space of the hotel more than makes up for all the bad. "
50,"Every phase of our stay at the Tikal Inn was excellent.  We traveled to the Tikal Inn from Flores on the hotel shuttle.  Upon arrival, they stored our luggage and we were immediately off for a guided tour of the Tikal historical site.  We pre-ordered our lunch before departing for the tour from a nicely varied menu.  Upon returning to the hotel, our rooms were ready for check-in.  The rooms are either individual cottages or a two-story cottage with four rooms in it.  The rooms were comfortable and well equipped (remember--you are in the middle of the jungle!)  There is electricity and hot water for only two hours or so each in the morning and evening...which was not a limitation in any way to us and perhaps added to the ""jungle ambiance"".  The room had a battery powered LED"
30,"This place is a good one or 2 night stay, please note there is only a couple oh ours of power each morning and evening. We did not have any hot or even warm water while we were there. The food is pretty good there in the evening. We ordered drinks that were on the menu, but they said they couldn't make them even though they clearly had the ingredients displayed in the bar case. It was kind of disappointing. "
40,"After visiting ten years ago, we were very surprised to see the improvements the Jungle Lodge has had. We had a room with two queen beds, a spacious bathroom, and an outdoor area with a hot tub and were very pleased with the size and quality of it. Being able to walk down the driveway of the hotel and right into the park is amazing!  The pool area is very nice and has a little bar. With a few delightful exceptions, the staff is helpful but not over-friendly and sometimes seem overwhelmed especially during mealtimes. The hotel is still under construction, the WiFi barely works, and after a few days we found ourselves turning to hotels and restaurants nearby for more food options. However, on New Year's Eve they had a delightful dining area set up near the lobby and a special"
40,"This hotel is basically in the middle of the Tikal National park. The ruins are about 20 mins walking distance. They are going through renovation but it was mostly in the main lobby area. It gets dark very early in the jungle and in winter when we visited. The best part was even though the electricity is shut off around 10 or 11 pm (I am not sure) the ceiling fan still remains on which helps to get a better night sleep. They also have mosquito nets and quality of beds was quite good. Yes it is slightly more expensive than the other places in the jungle but its worth price if one wants to have a good night sleep. Food is average, moderately priced. The only drawback was the water pressure in the shower was very low. Other than that it was very convenient for a one night stay to"
20,"In terms of proximity, this place is great. However, that's where the fun ends. This place is currently under construction and they don't stop at a reasonable time (say 6pm?) The internet sucks. The food is bad (overcooked Western). Why don't they try serving some local dishes? Have women make tortillas on site? There are a lot of easy ways to improve the food. They did offer a Guatemalan breakfast with fresh fruit that was decent. Save your Quetzals and eat at Comedor Tikal right outside the entrance to the park. Nice Guatemalan options at half the price. Other issues: when you have a shuttle coming, provide more staff to check people in. They were slow and disorganized. Also the internet is only available in the lobby and the pool area. And it didn't work well. I don't have to"
30,The hotel rooms were very nice except for the fact that we didn't know until we arrived that they shut off electricity and water at 10pm to 6am.  It was HOT and sweaty and or course dark.  You have to eat at the hotel and the food was never hot.  They were always doing construction and not very helpful.  The grounds are nice and a short walk to the ruins.
30,"We've stayed at all 3 of the Tikal hotels and this one is the most expensive.  It's also the closest to the ruins.  It has the most potential, but underperforms.  The hotel lobby is being remodeled at the moment and not all services are working.   For $115 per night you expect the lights in the lodge and the WiFi to work, but they don't. The staff seems to think that their remodeling project is something to be proud off. But if it means basic services don't work or are unavailable, that's nothing to be proud off.  Bottom line.  Nice cabins, beds and bathrooms.  And nice pool.  But this place is waaay overpriced. The other 2 hotels at Tikal are a better value.   Would not stay here again."
10,"Location is perfect but hen it comes to horrible customer service this place takes the cake. The front desk is not friendly what so ever. The gentleman I had to deal with always looked lost of confused when asked questions. Ripped me off with transportation from the bus stop to the hotel. At the end of my stay I expected a receipt and the gentleman said they do it by request only. Not helpful at all, in all the worst hotel I could have chosen. I ended up just sleeping here but to eat and make use of the pool I would go to the one next door. The staff were super friendly and very accommodating. I would not stay here again or recommend it to my friends. The only good thing about this hotel is the location other than that I would try the one next door."
40,"Quiet, good breakfast, helpful front desk, clean room...   Very centrally located -- just a few blocks from the Central Plaza/Park; also close to restaurants.  Front desk can connect you with mini buses to go to nearby sites (Atitlan, Pacayo, etc.)   Breakfast (about $5) wasn't included in room rate which was too bad.  Also not included was pick up at airport in Guatemala City.  That cost $37 for a late night private pick up."
40,"We arrived the first night and got a nice room at the Jaquar Inn as I was still recuperating from my bad experience at Zephyr Lodge in Lanquin... The room was very clean, big bed and good wifi - even though it was satellite based. The next day we opted to camp off our truck as we are overlanding across Central America. The staff is quite nice, the restaurant serves ok food considering where you are and the place gets really quiet at night, a good thing. When you are ready to explore Tikal, you are about 50 feet from the main gates, worth the stay. Hope this review was helpful!!!"
30,"The only reason to stay at this hotel is that it is just steps away from the entrance of Tikal.  The accommodations were fine for one night but I don't think that I could stay longer as it was a bit too rustic for me.  As the hotel is located in the jungle, it's hard to avoid the bugs of the jungle, especially with the lights on after dark.  They're attracted to the light so the only way to minimize the number of vistors is to call it an early night and turn off the lights.    The hotel has free Wi-Fi in the restaurant.  I recommend the sunrise tour that the hotel offers.  Cesar leads the tour at 4:00 am and it takes approximately 30 minutes by foot to get to the temple where everyone gathers for the sunrise.  Cesar makes sure that his group is the first one there as groups of"
40,"Tikal is such a special place and this hotel is lovely. We enjoyed our stay at the Jaguar Inn Tikal very much and I would happily stay here again.  We stayed in a bungalow (1c or d I believe) which is an upper storey room which three beds (one double and two singles). The beds were very comfortable and the bed linen fresh and clean. The shower had plenty of hot water and a good pressure. As with almost all places in Guatemala, you will need to place toilet paper in a waste paper bin next to the toilet. No wifi in our room as slightly too far from the public places but this did not bother us. The ground floor rooms looked the same but had a hammock outside.  There are screens over the windows to keep out bugs etc but we found a tiny scorpion in our room and several grasshopper"
40,"We traveled with 10 people- 4 kids, 6 adults to visit Tikal.  The lodge met us promptly at the Flores airport. Please note, you do need to have Guatemalan cash and pay for the park entrance fees in the airport before we left for the Lodge.    I had come to Jungle Lodge with some preconceived expectations since my sister had been there 9 years prior. They have been busy from 9 years ago— new rooms with very modern bathrooms and decor; swimming pool is great- kids loved the spraying fountains.  Our rooms had personal outdoor hot tubs.  They have a poolside bar.  Restaurant serves decent food (mostly American-although they did a special Guatemalan dinner for New Year’s Eve).    Tour guides are great!  We did Uaxactún the first day (Enrique) and Tikal sunrise extended and sunset"
50,you have to go to Tikal and after you pay the entry for the park you have 20mins road to the actual site. the hotel is really just next to the entrance of the trails.  they can book a guide for sunset/sunrise tour but it would cost you at least twice the price and our guide was not really great. we had no choice because went out of cash and for the standard guide and the tourist boot you can pay only cash. there is no atm and they cannot charge your card ang give you money.. we tried :) the restaurant looks fancy but the food is nothing special there is a small pool but the water was not clean. it was mainly leafs from the trees but we stayed at the bar for drinks the rooms are clean and spacious. privacy is guaranteed and the bathrooms are with window roof so look up while
40,"Great place to stay if you would like to visit the ruins outside busy times - the hotel organizes a daily sunrise tour with an experienced and knowledgable guide. Overall the hotel is really nicely equipped, the rooms beautiful and new and very clean. We had booked one of the bungalow rooms and in addition to the great decoration and spacious room, it had an outside shower, a personal jacuzzi and a little patio looking right into the jungle. The food at the restaurant is unfortunately very bland and the service below average."
50,"We stayed at the Jungle Lodge as part of an overnight tour. We were not expecting such an amazing facility. The room was beautiful, quiet, well-appointed and comfortable. The pool area was fabulous. The food was delicious. The jungle sounds were amazing. I even left my phone at the lodge by mistake and the staff got it to me through my tour company. I cannot recommend this place highly enough! If you can manage to stay here, do it! You will not be sorry!"
50,"Considering this place is located in the middle of the jungle, it was excellent! Internet and some other things were limited, so be sure to book your departure and your next place before you arrive. The rooms and the resort were excellent, and Tony was an amazing guide for the ruins."
50,"I can only say that everything was great including friendly helpful staff cleanliness food , location right in backyard of tikal ruins,facilities, atmosphere. True that electricity was only on in morning and evening but had small battery light on the iff hours. Anyway you will be out touring tikal ruins all day. Restaurant staff were lovely. Food good and very esthetic. Left one suitcase and they made sure to send it next morning early to my next destination free of charge. Lovely small pool so refreshing. Good hot shower."
30,"Our one-night stay over new year was perhaps too brief to get a full impression of the Tikal Inn. Our room was quite far down a jungle path - which while exciting, was difficult to get to in the dark as all power goes off (it's off the grid) at 10pm! The room was fairly basic and didn't have A/C. The pool area is lovely. As it's quite far from other options we ate there for dinner - and it was bland and mediocre food. However, the beautiful national park setting just about made up for it."
40,"We enjoyed our stay here. We were warned in advance about only having electricity and hot water for certain hours so were able to plan around that. If you stay here be sure to bring some kind of battery-operated light for the bathroom.There is a light in the bedroom that will work when the electricity is off. We had a rechargeable book-light that worked great. The internet was almost non-existent, so don't count on getting much done online. The restaurant was fine, just a bit expensive, but probably on par with the other hotels. We ate at the comador down the street a couple times which was better priced and had good food but with a very basic atmosphere. The hotel pool area looked very nice but we didn't have time to enjoy it. All in all, I was happy with my stay here."
40,"Though we were staying at Jungle Lodge, we decided to explore other venues for dinner and were not disappointed with the Tikal Inn.  Here, the welcome was warm, the service friendly and the food well-priced and good quality for a jungle lodge. We returned on another occasion and our impression was the same.  The margaritas were also very good!"
40,"We enjoyed the quiet simplicity of Hotel Tikal Inn. The staff was friendly and kind, and the waiters/waitresses were excellent. No internet at all. Electricity for a couple of hours daily, but that was ok with us. The liquados (fruit drinks) were delicious and the chicken stew. Carmen was a sweet waitress and very attentive. Our tour guide from the hotel was not an official Tikal Park guide, which was a disappointment. He didn't share nearly the good information that I heard the official guides sharing with other tours, and said he would only talk if we asked questions. Ask for an official park guide. Overall,  a fun-filled adventure."
40,"I have red the many opinions on this hotel and the others in the national park of tikal,Jaguar inn is a basic hotel to compare with many in the cities as well as the prices.but you have to make your trip not the hotel. when ever you decide to make a trip to the jungle like tikal  is beautiful rain forest or any place like Tikal do not expect to be perfect on the services,if you built your mind to have  what they have for you the trip will be much better,you will enjoy which is the plann do not spoil your trip enjoy your vacation with what they have to offer not with what you expect to have for you.For the enviroment I like jaguar inn to spend the night when necesary."
50,"We just returned to Belize (the Cayes) after spending two nights at Hotel Jaguar Inn at Tikal. The main reason for staying there is that it is a 20 minute walk to the temples. By being at this hotel we were able to go into the area starting at 6am (before the tour busses really started to arrive and while it was cool) then go to the hotel for a late breakfast (brunch?) which is served until 11:00. We spent the heat of the day at the hotel relaxing then returned to the ruins around 3:00 until 6:00 when we would have had to buy a Sunset ticket. The first night (Thursday) there were only a few other people and they were very quiet. The place is so tranquil.  We had the same server at all of our meals, Ronnie was excellent. The food that I had was very good (chicken peppian had good"
40,"Great hotel, considering it's in the middle of nowhere - huuuge bathroom - ok restaurant. If you book the sunrise tour consider that there is an additional fee per person apart from the entrance fee to the park, which is not mentioned anywhere. When we went it was so misty that not only didn't we see the sunrise, but not even the jungle under us from Temple IV. In the rest of the tour the mist added to the experience. Cesar was an amazing guide, highly knowledgeable and with excellent English and I highly recommend booking through the hotel with him. We were the first to get on the Temple, and the first to walk the rest of the site, he is very respected by other guides. Great experience in total! beware of the jam-eating pizote! ;)"
40,"The Jaguar Inn was a nice place to stay.  You're right in the dead center of the Tikal Park, so you can really optimize your time in the park, wake up super early to do a sunrise hike, etc.  They only keep the main power on for certain hours each day, so you need to plan ahead if you want a warm shower.  Wifi was spotty."
30,The hotel was basic but nice.  Shower pressure and temperature was good but limited to certain hours (same with electricity).  Food from the restaurant was good too.  They arranged the shuttle service from the airport and we had a comfortable and safe ride there at 8pm in the evening.  Javier even phoned ahead to order our dinner since the restaurant closed at 9pm.
50,"This hotel is wonderful, Clan and comfortable and perfectly located to the National Park Entrance. The staff are all friendly and helpful.  There is a pool too for a nice afternoon siesta.  Booked 3 tours through the Jungle Lodge with Tony. Couldn't have asked for a better contact, Tony knows the jungle probably better than any guide out there!"
40,"Stayed here the night before my sunrise tour in Tikal. Had a single bedroom and a shared bathroom. Excellent for the price. Much more convenient than staying in Flores if you are going to do the Sunrise tour. The place was clean, and my room was nice and cool with just the fan (there was no AC). However, be aware that the electricity to the entire place is off for part of every day (albeit at pretty convenient times like the middle of the day when you are unlikely to be in your room).   The hotel also organizes shuttle transportation and Tikal tours themselves. I highly recommend the extended sunrise tour with Antonio (Tony) Ortiz. He is hilarious, incredibly knowledgeable, and adds some unique locations to the tour.   Oh- and just a couple pieces of advice: 1)  There are no"
40,"The place is great, it is a perfect place to stay and then do the early (wake up at 3:30am) Tikal sunrise tour (if you can get Tony Ortiz, you will get the best tour ever!).  The tour gets 5 stars because Tony is a walking encyclopedia of knowledge, and just a cool guy.  The lodge itself is nice, has a swimming pool and simple rooms with shared bathrooms.  The food, unfortunately, is mediocre, not bad, just nothing to write home about.  There are some locals spots away from the hotels that throw down a much better meal at a much better price if you are willing to walk 10 minutes."
30,"The Jungle Lodge really is in the jungle. There are little casas spread on the property. The casas are spacious and have a terrace and even a jacuzzi. The casas itself are nicely furnished, kind of a mix between old colonial traveller mixed with modern times.  BUT: Our casa was heavily fumigated. It seemed everything: floor, wall, sofa, the mattresses, the bedsheets,  in the bathroom, even when I lifted the yacuzzi cover the smell hit me. It's heavy stuff. We all got issues with it, as in our lymphe in the throat going nuts, headaches, bags underneath our eyes, one of my daughters threw up. If you decide to go and you are bothered by that poison, ask for a casa that had not been recently fumigated. Unfortunately, we did not have that choice. They changed all the sheets the next"
30,"Location was good, just a few minutes walk from the hotel to the Tikal ruins. BUT hotel is expensive. Food is basic but very expensive. Complimentary water, at the very least, would be nice since accommodations are expensive. No electricity for most of the day."
40,"Great location in terms of proximity to the park - it's a 5minute walk to the entrance I arranged transportation to/from the Inn for a 7pm flight arrival and 7am flight departure, both worked out really well The pool is great to have after a morning in the park The rooms are sparce, but totally adequate The food was good and service overall was very good Warning that you can hear the howler monkeys in the morning and some of them sound very close by!  We were a little freaked the first night not knowing what is was that were were hearing - a story we will remember for a very long time!"
30,"We stayed in one of the bungalows next to the pool which was nice enough. Unfortunately, the weather wasn't great so we couldn't make use of the pool. Being in the park is great as you can walk over with your guide for the sunrise tour rather than having to get transport there at such an early hour.  The evening meal is part of their package though it wasn't much to write home about. Very average food served very slowly. Overall I'd say it's just about worth the extra expense of staying here rather than travelling in from Flores but if budget is a primary consideration then the Flores option is probably preferable."
50,"This hotel is very nice- it has a couple of things that people may not like-  but overall it is wonderful. The negatives first 1. Limited electricity- 6-8 am and 6-9:30 pm- which is also the only time the hot water heater works 2.The Wi-Fi is not very good- and not in room at all However- 1,- Your in the jungle- really the electricity was not an issue for me- there is a battery light and I had my headlamp 2- again- not really an issue- I found the water to be warm- even when there was no electricity The positives far outweigh the above issues The rooms are huge and comfortable- nice porch-at night it cools off and a nice cross breeze with the windows open- also- your in the jungle- with lots of wildlife around- and you can walk to the park in 5 min- which is really the only"
40,We arrive around 10 PM and my surprise that there was no electricity. Nobody told us that from 6pm at night time there no power. So bring extra charger portable chargers for phone. But it was beautiful and peaceful  quiet and  clean. I found love with this place. The food was amazing breakfast and lunch. In the morning you can hear all the beautiful birds sounds in the night time it's so peaceful and quiet. Very friendly staff and helpful. The shuttle service was excellent. I can totally recommend this place. And trust me there's only three hotels around the Tikal  jungle . And they also have big clean pool. 
30,"It's a real shame that this hotel doesn't make more of itself.  It's in a perfect location for exploring the park and has a nice pool.  The rooms are ok too but the service wasn't great.  There is a slightly odd atmosphere about the place.  It seemed like there were lots of staff hanging around in silence not doing very much and looking bored..... However, if more than one table requied serving this seemed to cause a real challenge...."
50,"As if visiting the fantastic ruins of Tikal were not enough, the newly refurbished cabins were great, the dining room and bar very nice, and we had the most knowledgeable and friendly guide who turned out to be the owner, son of one of the original archeologists to dig at Tikal and an archeologistand anthropologist himself. The 4 am jungle tour, with Anthony aka Tony, could not have been more informative or magical with an awakening jungle and pyramids appearing out of the mist. Accommodating and compassionate about this almost mystical ‘world’, Tony has created a first class experience not to be missed- an adventure of a lifetime!"
40,"I agree with everything written in previous reviews, lovely staying right on the site, just walking into Tikal in the early morning cannot be missed. Jungle lodge is clean and basic, the beds are comfortable, if you’re taking work with you and need wifi, as was my partner and i, this isn’t the place for you. The food is basic. The real plus is the staff, happy and cheerful, laughing with us at our attempts to speak the language."
50,Set in pristine jungle the rooms are beautifully appointed. Find animals and birds within the hotel grounds. Tikal ruins are within walking distance of the hotel. It would be great to have access to filtered water rather than using once only small plastic bottles of water. Give gratuities direct to staff to ensure that they receive it.
50,"If you want to experience something different and really enjoy your inn in Tikal, this is the perfect place. Rooms are great, confortable, and really clean. But you must be prepared to sleep early as all electricity is cut off at 11:00pm. You will rest well and will hear the nature sounds. The location is perfect, few meters to the National Park."
40,"We stayed in the Jungle Lodge for two nights in July as we wanted to experience staying in the jungle, receive the genuine experience but with a certain degree of comfort - I am a big fan of indoor plumbing..call me a diva.  We handled all of the transfers ourselves as we were heading in from GC and out via the Belizean border. Upon arrival, to the park itself, the pricing for entering/staying in the park is confusing and independent of the cost of the hotel itself and wasn't really made clear by the lodge before booking. I would advise anyone to have an ample amount of cash on them for the duration of their stay because there are no ATM's in Tikal. Fortunately, the hotel were able to accept card - but I never like to risk this when I can avoid it.   Upon arrival, we were really"
50,We stayed in Jaguar Inn for one night in April. Room was clean and convenient. Asked for a Sun Rise tour next morning and it was very well arranged for us. Will definitely stay there again and recommend it to all our friends.
50,"This place was great. My girlfriend and I stayed at Jaguar Inn for one night, did their sunset tour of the Mayan Ruins, and used their private shuttle transportation option from Belize City to Tikal, and then from Tikal to Belmopan, which was our next locale. Here's a review of all the things we used from the Jaguar Inn.  The Inn Itself: The Jaguar Inn is located right inside the national park. We rented one of their more expensive rooms. I can't remember why, but we thought it would be better. We got a very large room for the two of us that had four beds. Hilarious!  The room was very clean. We went during the dry season and the only bugs we saw in our room were a small spider and some tiny, tiny ants that seemed to like our toothpaste. Once we put that back into our ziplock"
50,"Best food on my trip, most relaxing atmosphere, and I loved the freedom of being right at the park entrance. I went out for 4 hours in the morning, came back to the hotel when the heat and the crowds hit, and then went back out around 4 PM after the crowds had passed - had most of the park to myself!! Plus the staff was excellent (particularly David & Samuel). Did not want for anything and have absolutely nothing bad to say about the entire facility. Thank you!"
40,"Tikal is the most important place to my family. This is where my husband and I met 13 years ago. For my son's 10th birthday and our 13 year anniversary we wanted to bring our kids to see this amazing place.  We've been to Tikal several times, but other than the night my husband and I met (we were camping) we have never stayed on the property.  With kids I am not as keen to camp, and prefer to stay in hotels with private bathrooms these days. Jaguar Inn was a perfect option!  The hotel is inside the park and less than a minute walk from the actual entrance to the ruins.   The rooms are pretty basic, and the lights go off at 10 pm, but that is regulated by the park. And honestly what do you need here?   You wake up with the animals and go to sleep with the sunset.  Plus, the hotel"
30,"The hotel serves it's basic function of hosting guests interested in exploring the park well.  One doesn't come here to loiter in the hotel lobby; rather, one comes to get out into the park. It's no-frills with clean, well-lit rooms and strong, hot showers. It's overpriced based on Guatemalan standards but as competition in the park is scarce they can afford to charge what they do. The restaurant prices are equally expensive and the food, while tasty, is dull and familiar. Also, as it was the end of the weekend, they were out of many of the many items. "
40,"I really enjoyed staying here for one night, arriving 4pm and leaving around 3pm the next day. Front desk was very friendly and efficient let me charge my phone in their office when there was no electricity during the day which was nice. Also arranged transport to my Flores hotel. Loved the sunrise tour, had a small group and good guide. Bring a torch or use smartphone torch app. Loved the kitch cabanas, hearing the howler monkeys in the night and lounging around the pool."
30,"If you want to stay in Tikal, there aren't many options, but I wouldn't stay more than one night.  If you want to see other sites around, it would be far cheaper and easier to rent a car in Flores.  We stayed 2 nights, and our package included breakfast, dinner and a 4 hour guided tour each day.  The food was nothing exciting, but not bad either.  Our room was quite musty smelling with only one outlet to plug in the lamp.  Since there was only electricity a few hours a day, it was difficult to charge things.   The 4 hour guided tours were something of a disappointment.  Our guide would seat himself down at every opportunity, for as long as possible, regardless of whether there was anywhere for anyone else to sit or not.  He kept making up reasons to sit silently for long periods"
30,"Great location, if you want to see sunset or sunrise. Couple more comments: - be aware, that if you're booking budget double room - it is located in a building on a far side of hotel area and pathway there is not paved yet (as of start of 2016), and therefore it's not possible to conveniently roll wheeled suitcases - you'll have to carry them on for approximately 100 meters, which may be quite a challenge for women or during hot time of a year. - when we signed-up for a package (sunrise tickets, dinner, breakfast) they charged us extra 5USD, hidden behind exchange rates calculations. When I asked for an itemized receipt - numbers have clearly shown it. This is why I'm giving hotel 3 stars review, and not 4."
40,"Overall, this place was great for a short visit. The staff was very friendly and accommodating and the property was lovely and convenient. I had no problems with getting plenty of hot water and water pressure for the showers, despite the time limitations, which didn't bother me. It was great overlooking the pool just outside our room door, but make note of your room location. Our room was right next to the kitchen and as a result, there was some noise for a couple of hours at night.  Be sure to book Roxy for your Tikal Ruins guide. She is a ball of fire and extremely knowledgable about birding and the history of the ruins. She is a lot of fun to talk to and really enhanced our overall experience.   If I go back, I would do it all the same."
40,"Our room was spacious and very clean. Beds were very comfortable. The pool was very nice and nice gardens around it. The restaurant was very good. We had the Guatemalan dishes and were not disappointed. Only comment, coffee was TERRIBLE, undrinkable... I bought a coffee at the Italian espresso kiosk at the park office. Electricity was only on for a few hours a day.  WiFi was a joke. Overall it was better than we expected, but nothing luxurious. You must know it's overprice because of its location, not because of what they offer."
40,"Couldn't beat the location. Everyone that worked at Jaguar Inn were great and super nice. Only problem we had was they ran out of a lot of food on Monday, yet still charged us full price for a club sandwich missing 3 ingredients!"
50,we had a very comfortable room at the jaguar Inn.  They picked us up at the airport at 7:30 ($60) when no other transport was available.  Rooms was great.  Evening on the hammock listening to the howler monkeys was unforgettable.  A better option than a day trip from Flores in my opininon
40,"Only issue, we were with a group of 8 and had lunch alittle later and it took a while to get our food on both occasions.  The hotel staff were very pleasant and did what they could to make us happy.  Great setting."
40,We stayed here for two nights. We booked online with no problems.  The room was clean and bed comfortable. The shower had hot water at specific times in the morning and evening but generally this was when you would be back at the room anyways.   There is a restaurant which serves a variety of pasta dishes which were good and there is a selection of hot and cold drinks as well as internet access. Its not fast but enough to email and sort out our next nights accommodation. As you will read in other reviews the food is pricy partly due to the remoteness of the hotel in the park and because there isn't much choice.   Its the perfect place to stay though to be able to do the sunrise tour at the park paying a guide to take you up to the top of the temple to see the sunrise and hear
50,Stay here if you plan to do sunrise or sunset tours. Both I highly recommend you do with Ceasar who can be booked through this hotel. Make sure you bring a flashlight. The hotel restaurant serves good food and is a very easy place to mingle with other travelers. The staff even helped me learn some more Spanish!
50,"The room was great.  Understand you're in the middle of the jungle and now downtown.  No a/c.  No electricity after around 10 or so at night.  Although there was electricity to keep the room fan going.  I'm not sure how that works exactly, maybe, well I could speculate all day, the point is the fan kept working.  The room was clean, great pool, and a restaurant/ bar nearby.   OK, the reason you're here is the Tikal Park.  You can use credit cards for the hotel, but you'll need cash for the park.  They will accept Q's and dollars, not Euros.  I helped a couple from Italy by exchanging some dollars for Euros.  Bring dollars. Next, my trip was enchanced greatly by using Tony as my guide.  I found him through the front desk.  For two days we hiked all over Tikal.  I'm able to"
50,"Really good, but not that cheap. It is located right at the park entrance, right in the jungle. Apes come and eat here, some birds as well (including Tucans). Very clean, rooms are nice, awesome restaurant (but also not that cheap)."
30,"The rooms were very nice but the lack of electricity during much of the day made this hotel hard to love. For those used to ""roughing it"", you'll have no trouble but the lack of air conditioning was hard for us and our 2 kids. Because our tour left early in the morning, we had to get ready in the dark, which was a fun adventure but difficult. The staff at the restaurant went out of their way to provide us with custom vegetarian to go breakfast bags."
30,"The convenience of the jungle lodge is unbeatable. If you're coming to Tikal for the early morning temple hike it is completely worth it. It's quite the experience but I wouldn't want to stay there for more than one night. If you do some research you'll find lodgings not far from the park, making day trips incredibly easy. The staff is very friendly and we didn't have any language barriers. The pool was well maintained and very refreshing on such a hot day.   I think the most important thing to note is that due to the location the facility is run entirely off of generators so there are times when power is scheduled to be off. Bring non-electronic things to keep yourself of children amused. "
40,This is a great place to stay to visit the Mayan ruins of Tikal. The pool and gardens are beautiful. The rooms with no bathrooms are sparse but are all you need for your stay. The restaurant is nice and the food ok. You can spend an enjoyable afternoon at the pool relaxing after a hot walk around the ruins. You are 5 mins from the gate of the ruins and then another 15 mins to the site. If you fly into Flores it is another hour and a half drive to this hotel but you are then right in the National park.  The wifi is available at the pool and restaurant and pretty good for being in the jungle. A couple of nights is probably all you need here as there really isn't much to do once you have visited the ruins. You might get woken up by the howler monkeys or get to see them swinging
40,"We stayed at the Jungle Lodge at Tikal National Park as part of a two-day tour we booked out of San Ignacio, Belize. We weren't sure what to expect, but were pleasantly surprised at our good fortune to stay at this hotel. Yes, there is no air conditioning, but the fan does work through the night and that was enough to keep us sleeping comfortably. The room and the king-sized bed were clean and comfortable. Although not spacious, we spent little time in the room. With Tikal National Park just down the street, we spent all our time in the park. The bungalows have a small covered porch and chairs where it is easy to sit and listen to the sounds of the jungle. We would definitely stay here again. The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. Great pool and grounds. The restaurant"
50,"In our opinion: perfect!  First of all: the entrance to the Tikal Park is around the corner. We spend 4 nights in Jungle Lodge, thus giving access to Tikal during 3 days. Not only to watch the temples but there is quite some wildlife in the park (birds as tucans, aracaris, motmots, lots of monkeys, turkeys, coati's, agouti's etc), and, the 'feel' is different during an early morning visit compared with a late afternoonvisit. Do no rush Tikal (which quite some people probably have to if they come on a daytrip) and spent at least two or three nights in Jungle Lodge (or one of the other two hotels next to the park). The room in which we stayed was clean and of good quality and well maintained.  The whole complex is very well maintained. A 'winner' is the swimming pool: we preferred"
30,"This is a fair priced option in a great location right at the park entrance.  It is a good place to stay if you are having a sunrise or sunset tour.  We were a family of four staying in a standard room with two double beds.  I think I would get a larger room if I ever returned.   The Lodge is a refurbished archeological camp, and has pleasant lighting and finishes.  It is surrounded by jungle and there is wildlife all over the place.  You can hang out in the nice swimming pool and watch monkeys in the trees.  The pool was a VERY welcome relief from the heat and humidity.     The lodge does not provide enough drinking water.  They give you two 8 ounce bottles when you arrive and then charge you for more.  The food that they provide is adequate and overpriced.  But you are likely"
30,"The staff were friendly. The grounds are quite attractive and you feel like you're next to the jungle (which you are!). The pool was pretty good and the bathrooms were clean. Our room was tiny, about room for the bed and our bags, not much more. If you're uncomfortable with animals getting in, be warned that we had a large cockroach, flying beatles and a scorpion. This is the jungle, obviously, but don't assume creatures won't get in your room. The ceiling fan worked in our room and we didn't have any mosquitos. The room was uninviting though and it was still quite warm through the night. The power went off several times although there's not a lot of reason to charge your phone as the wi-fi - when it's available - is useless. The restaurant was quite good. Service was good and"
40,"This hotel is right in the middle of the jungle. This means there is wildlife all around. Unfortunately it also means that the rooms are basic, and power and wifi rarely function. At the restaurant the chips are very good."
50,"The location right next to the entrance of the site, set back deep into the national park, is truly unbeatable! Not to mention the hotel trains the most knowledgeable tour guides, each of whom have something different to offer on the various tours. Because the archeological site is packed between the hours of 9 am and 3 pm with buses from the town of Flores (about an hour and twenty minutes drive away), the sunrise and sunset tours are a must to give any justice to this exquisite site! The hotel itself offers very clean and comfortable rooms with electricity for several key hours in the morning and evening. The staff is very hospitable and more than happy to help in any way, the food is sufficiently nourishing after a long day of hiking around the sites, and I would definitely"
50,"The location right next to the entrance to the archeological site is truly unbeatable. Not only that, but the guides trained by the hotel are extremely knowledgable and each one has something different to teach. The hotel offers both sunrise and sunset tours, which I highly recommend otherwise the crowds at Tikal during the day bused in from Flores are overwhelming. The rooms at the inn are very clean and comfortable, and offer electricity for key hours in the morning and evening each day. It is amazing a hotel so deep in the jungle can run so efficiently!  The food in the restaurant is comfort food and is more than satisfying, and everyone working in the hotel does a fine job of hospitality. Consider staying more than one night to truly experience this amazing site! "
20,The location is good for the park but everything else is really bad here. It's really overpriced as well. The staff don't make an effort at all as they don't have to (it's one of only 3 hotels in the park so they have constant visitors despite their poor service. I wouldn't stay here again.
30,"Granted your in the middle of the jungle so there's not much choice and it's going to be expensive for the convenience. I've travelled enough to know and accept this. However the staff look over worked and so generally don't really care about the guests. As soon as you get there it's give me money for this this and this.   Also the sunrise tour that they do a deal on with the meal package is subject to an extra 100Q per person park entrance for going in early, not the hotels fault but just letting you guys know as I wasn't expecting that.   It is what it is and the chance to explore the park without the crowds and heat, ie sunset and sunrise make the hotel worth the money it costs to stay here, not the hotel itself.   Wouldn't bother paying the extra for a bungalow again as I"
40,"Hotel Tikal Inn is great because of its location.  It isn't particularly good value, but it is right inside Tikal which affords you the opportunity to wander around without worrying about transport.  Although they really push the sunrise tour, I would opt for hiring a guide to do a sunset tour instead. Visibility seems to be a problem with the sunrise tour as things are quite foggy. Also,  by the time you get back from that, hot water is gone for the day at the hotel. Another useful piece of info is that using a credit card at the hotel incurs a 7% fee so bring cash.  "
40,"Hotel was clean and comfortable.  Unlike other lodging in the area, the fan ran throughout the night to keep the room cool.  Most everything runs on a generator and will shut down around 10pm and turn back on in the morning.  The showers had hot water from 6-9 but I would suggest getting yours early.  My husband got a hot shower at the beginning of that time range but I waited closer to 8 and did not get any hot water.  The restaurant was average and the most expensive we had experienced on our trip.  Saying that, we realize we were in a National Park and prices will most often be higher and should be expected.  Overall, a nice place to stay."
40,"We stayed just one night here. The location is unbeatable. We considered staying outside the park and catching a bus in - but we were glad to have stayed here. We got up for a sunrise tour at 5am, I dont think you could do that if staying outside. It was great to stay in the jungle setting too, very peaceful. The room was very large, and surprisingly comfortable, the shower was fine too - just the hot water took a few minutes to come through.  The only downside was the food situation, because you basically have to eat at their restaurant which can be a bit pricey. A simple sandwich of two slices and ham and cheese was about $4-5, 1.5L bottle of water $2-3, and a bowl of pasta with bolognaise - about $8-10. We only had to have 2 meals at this price so it was ok. But I wouldnt"
40,"Nice rooms but don't get room 2 as our shower didn't work.Good food at restaurant.2 minute walk to entrance to the park.For anyone wanting to make their way to Belize from Tikal,a taxi man in the Tikal carpark took 4 of us to the Belize border for Q350 between us (€35 for 4 people!),took about hour and half.If you are leaving your luggage there for the day,know that there in no storage room,bags are left in restaurant but seems very safe."
40,"Given the range of reviews of the Jaguar Inn on T/A we weren't expecting much, other than proximity to the Park entrance.   The place is fine for a one- or two-night stay while you explore the ruins.  The food was fine/wait staff alternately attentive and absent/porch hammocks at every room were comfy and the bed/shower just fine.    No one would say, ""Let's go to the Jaguar Inn for our vacation,"" but it's just fine when you say, ""what's a convenient place to stay when we visit Tikal,"" which is, BTW, stellar."
30,We chose the Jaguar Inn as we wanted to be able to spend all day in the park and come and go as we pleased. The location is perfect for this - we were up early and explored the park for 4 hours - returned for lunch and then back to the ruins until sunset. If this is for you then this hotel is for you.  The hotel rooms are average at best - poor linens - 2 thin towels but there is a ceiling fan and screens on the windows. The rooms are large and there is hot water. You can live with this for a night or 2. The restaurant staff are - well - the word staff may be incorrect. Someone needs to train them in customer service - they really have no idea. They are very nice but really lack any service skills. Rather humorous after watching what happens - or rather what doesn't happen  -
40,"Jungle lodge is lovely. Rooms are clean with terraces overlooking the jungle bd the night is filled with the sounds and smells of the jungle. There is a very welcome pool to recover from the humidity, a reasonably priced restaurant and really nice communal lounge. Staff are friendly and the lodge is a 5 minute walk to the Tikal ruins. Monkeys and all manner of wildlife in the gardens."
40,"We stayed here to visit Tikal and checked in late. The room was clean and very accommodating. I wish it had AC but I think it would've taken away from the sounds of the jungle. The room was supposed to have a 'plasma TV' but didn't. However, that was perfectly okay as it forced us outside to enjoy the grounds.   The restaurant was amazing and great value for the money. However, our favorite part was Nicolasa. She was our waitress and was just above and beyond friendly and helpful. She made the stay even more enjoyable. If she isn't a staff trainer, she should be. She answered our questions, helped with a concern and provided advice. Just amazing service.   Thanks guys!! "
50,The best place to stay while visiting Tikal. From your room you hear the monkeys in the forest. Wonderfull! The hostel rooms are simple. For more comfort choose a normal room. Dinner and breakfast are great.
40,"This is the best option for accommodation if you want to beat the crowds to Tikal. The accommodation is what you'd expect in the only hotel in the jungle, but it is a great experience. You can hear the monkeys howling during the night which is fun.   The food is a bit ordinary, but it's the jungle."
50,The combination of being able to go to Tikal early morning and late evening and spend day with the pool was perfect. Sunrise tour arranged in the hotel was expensive and on top we had day tickets and not entirely clear if that was needed and then we also had to buy sunset tickets. Food menu was not elaborate but quality good.
20,"Altho I would return to Jaguar Inn, it's only because it is so important to stay within the park, and because the guide Cesar is an amazing, knowledgeable person. From the moment we arrived at the airport in Flores, the hotel screwed up. Despite our confirmed reservation, no one was there to meet us for the 90 minute drive to Tikal. Finally a lone Jaguar Inn driver holding the name of another person agreed to call the hotel. After a lot of grumpy delays they said he could bring us there, but we'd have to go first to get $40.in quetzales for park entry fee (dollars not accepted). This entailed a long wait at the bank, but the driver was pleasant and patient. We finally arrived to have the receptionist look over and over our prepaid reservation as though we were trying to rob the"
40,"Very nice place to stay. It's a pity that we had just 1 night there and mostly it was just night over before Mayas pyramids. Beautiful surroundings, comfortable bungalow. Would be nice to spend more time there. Staff could be more polite and helpful."
10,"I can't count how many times I found myself saying ""I hate this place"" during our stay at the Jaguar Inn Tikal.   The hotel staff could hardly be bothered to be any help at all.  In trying to figure out travel plans, we approached the staff to see what arrangements could be made.  It was like a game of 20 questions.  They had the information and would tell you the answer if....and only if...you asked the right question.  It became so frustrating I gave up.  They wouldn't explain anything or tell you about the options of getting the hell out of Tikal unless specifically asked.  You just couldn't get a full picture out of these people no matter how hard one tried.  We had thought that staying in Tikal made sense since we were going to see there for the purpose of seeing it.  Do"
50,"I stayed here for six nights and found it extremely enjoyable.  The staff were very helpful finding me guides such as Hector and Cesar, and drivers Manuel and Elder.  Hector capably guided me through the park and gave a thorough background of Maya history. Elder did an excellent job navigating an extremely muddy road to Uaxactun, where Cesar offered his professional insight and wonderful sense of humor.  Cesar even used a laser pointer and smartphone to call up information to verify and discuss.  The Jaguar Inn menu is delicious-- I recommend the Pyramid or Granola-yogurt-fruit medley for breakfast.  Fresh fruit, coffee, and juices are always available.  For dinner, try the Pollo a la Montana, and especially the local recipe for Chicken Pepian.  Be sure to try Gallo, a good"
50,"The Jaguar Inn was the appropriate setting for our night in Tikal Park with jungle landscaping, toucans flying through & turkeys trotting by. But also important was our bungalow with a hammock on the porch, just a short walk from the restaurant/place to hang out & meet other travelers. It was here that we met Cesar who offered a $20 4am walk in the park & a climb up Temple IV to watch the sun rise. The menu prices were reasonable, the food excellent & the staff very friendly. the price of a bungalow was reasonable, too (booked online). I'd heard that mosquitoes & other insect pests would be a problem, but not so. I can't recommend this place enough for your stay at Tikal!"
20,This is one of the only three hotels inside the Tikal Park . They don't really care about quality and customer care because they know that there are no alternatives. Don't even try to send them an email because they won't reply.  Rooms are at least spacious.  Quality of food was poor on both dinner and breakfast. Breakfast was not included in my case
30,"We stayed overnight for the sole purpose of doing the sunrise tour. This hotel was fine for that. The accommodations were a little better than basic. Virtually nonexistent wifi and limited electricity. The sunrise tour had a lot of people on it, so if there is a way to book a private version of the tour this might be a better option. Also, the dining room is not large enough to accommodate everyone eating at the same time, so if you don't want to wait, go when it opens."
50,"My family and I spent three wonderful nights at the Hotel Tikal Inn. The location can't be beat, the room was spacious and clean, and the food was perfectly fine. There were many highlights (e.g., sunrise tour, sunset tour, animal spotting, the swimming pool, getting to know some of the hotel's interesting guests on tours and in the eating area), but one of the truly extraordinary ones was meeting the proprietor Roxy Ortiz who has an advanced degree in archaeology. Don't miss one of her tours!"
30,"Tikal, the park, is awesome. But I would not recommend staying at Tikal Inn. It would be better to stay in Flores (which is a beautiful island), and just shuttle up and back for the day to Tikal.   There is so much confusion going on between the Inn and the customers.   On the shuttle from Flores, there were two ladies who had pre-paid their entrance fee to the park (you go through the park entrance to get to the hotel). The shuttle drivers refused to honor the paper they had, and made them pay the entrance fee. The ladies did get a refund, but not after a long argument in the shuttle. Not a great way to start your vacation.   After I did the sunrise tour, I overheard a family trying to figure out why they had to pay ANOTHER entrance fee if they left the park after the sunrise"
50,"We took a tour with roxy, the manager in the morning, and returned to the hotel. the rooms in the back are ""in the rainforest,"" a pretty neat experience. Each time we walked to the room we saw lots of monkeys playing in the trees, and we were constantly surrounded by bird songs and ""sounds of the jungle.""   The people were very nice. we bought oranges from some vendors in the parking lot and the staff in the kitchen cut them for us without question, and even served them on a plate (and they disbthe same with a pineapple for someone else). Tamales are a christmas tradition in guatemala, and Roxy prepared us a lovely homecooked tamale for us to try!  The pool and hotel grounds are lovely, and provide a perfect break from the ruins in the hottest and busiest part of the day. The"
50,"My daughter and I just spent two magical nights at the Jungle Lodge in Tikal. Everything was perfect. The rooms exceeded my expectations. Clean, comfortable, and upscale. The only way we knew we were not in a luxury hotel in a city was the fact that we had no a/c and no electricity during the day. Oh and the sounds of the howler monkeys and the jungle out your window. Would definitely recommend."
50,"Our family (2 kids - 10 and 8 - and 2 adults) stayed in one of the newer cabanas - we all thought it was super fantastic, clean, and very well kept for literally being in the middle of the jungle. Yes, you hear jungle noises (monkeys play in the trees above you and drop nuts onto the tin roof at night - imagine firecracker sounds!), yes there are some bugs, yes the electricity is limited, and there is no A/C... but there is hot water, ceiling fans run all night, good food, and you should bring a flashlight and expect to be warm. It is easy to walk to Tikal Park (20 minutes to the Plaza Mayor) - swim mid-day, and re-enter the park for sunset (or sunrise).   Benecio was our guide for 2 half-day tours of the park. He was wonderful with our family (and extended family that included"
50," I highly recommend staying in the Jungle, close to Tikal, for your visit! It is an incredible experience to fall asleep and awake to the sounds of the jungle: howler and spider monkeys, cicadas, birds, etc.   The staff here is friendly, attentive, and helpful. They even went out of their way to help us to book a ticket when their wifi was really slow (which it just is).   Upon arrival, we were impressed by the construction of the buildings and the presentation of the rooms. The lodges, connected by stone paths, are inviting. The rooms are clean, and construction has made efforts to close off ceilings and walls to minimize bugs and other creatures. (It is impossible, I think, to eliminate the bugs. The mosquito nets will help you sleep comfortably). This construction is unlike"
50,My teenage daughter and I loved staying here. We didn't sleep as great as we'd thought because the sounds of the jungle were loud (this is a plus!) the howler monkeys and birds are quite vocal. Food was great too. Wish I could recommend the guides we had but they weren't thought the hotel. But Marco and Roberto ensured we made it from the border to Flores to Jungle Lodge to Tikal Mayan ruins and back to the border. Great experience. Beautiful Grounds. My daughter loved the restaurant (decent wine and great coffee!)
20,"We are always very concerned when having to leave less than positive feedback especially for hotels and restaurants because we are aware that people’s livelihoods can be affected. Having said that TripAdvisor exists to offer truthful and accurate perceptions of customers and it is at the end of the day up to business owners to act on the non-emotional feedback if they are willing and able. There are many good things about this hotel and many things that did not meet our expectations. On the good side the location is great if you do not want to travel from Flores early in the morning, stay all day in Tikal and then travel back to Flores in the evening. We wanted to spend at least a night in the jungle and having had a very early start flying from Guatemala City to Flores,"
40,"Location is great. Tikal is amazing and to wake to the sound of howler monkeys and birds was just the best.  Rooms were nice but no aircon so if you're looking to escape the humidity then no chance. I didn't mind it having spent time in hostels for weeks. That said... Someone needs to talk to these people about customer service. It may be a Guatemalan thing but I honestly felt like I was putting people out asking for something or/and they would barely acknowledge my request leaving me wondering if there was a misunderstanding. Like I said though, a cultural thing?! There was one guy in this place that was really cool and helpful. "
40,We stayed at Jaguar Inn for 3 nights over Christmas and had a lovely time.  You get a real jungle experience with electricity and hot water limited times but it doesn't cause a problem.  The Christmas Eve dinner was great and totally unexpected treat.  The location is great for the park.  We took the sunrise tour at 4am but it is definitely worth it.  A great guide and we were lucky with the weather.  The noise of the Howler monkeys at daybreak above the rainforest is a memory that will stay with us.  The zipline canopy tour organised by the hotel was great and we fully recommend it.  we felt totally safe and our guide Alberto was very reassuring.  Fully recommend for a Tikal adventure.
20,"First off - save you money all together - stay in Flores where you have more options and just join a tour to Tikal leaving from town. It's not that much more of an inconvenience. But if you must stay in the park...  Stayed at the Jaguar Inn for two nights in October 2013. It was a toss up between there and the Tikal Inn, but something was wrong with Tikal Inn's online booking at the time we were trying to reserve, so stayed at the Jaguar. If it is low season and you are thinking of staying at the Jaguar to save costs, think again. They have a lower room rate, but the food on site and extra tours really added up. Currently Tikal Inn includes breakfast, dinner and a Sunrise tour in their room packages, which is cheaper than adding on those costs at Jaguar. At the time Jaguar"
30,"Jaguar Inn was pretty basic and in most any city would be much in need of some updates, but in light of it's location in the middle of the jungle and right next to Tikal, I found it to be clean and comfortable for a night in the park. The staff was very friendly and helpful, and while it was expensive for being pretty basic accomodations, being in the middle of the park is highly recommended (do it for one night). There will be bugs and probably rain, or at least humidity, but the room itself was clean and a good break after a day exploring the park. They also offered a guide for sunset/sunrise tours (additional charge of course) and he was great."
50,"This was a nice hotel. We added a tour to our stay and we went into the jungle at 4 am to what the jungle wake up and listen to the growler monkeys wake the jungle up. Unfortunately it was raining on that morning and these monkeys just didn't want to wake up. We went back a couple of hours later and they were wide awake and growling their heads off, bless!!"
40,"Stayed here for 2 nights,nice hotel in a good location right next to the Tikal National Park.  Had one of the top floors in the hotel which was nice overlooking the pool.  Service was a bit slow at the restaurant though."
40,"Arrived for a one night stay at Tikal Inn. Arrived on 12/02/2015 and took a pool side room. The room I had was on the 2nd floor- I think it was 802. The staff and everyone there was great. It is a basic room- fan, bed, and shower. Only complaints that I would voice are the following; a) Staying in the two story bungalows that you are near the septic tank and the odor may offend some people b) I was notified by the staff that I had to check out at 11:00 AM even though the hotel was not crowded and I could have stayed in the pool longer to catch my bus to Flores. (really- ?) The hotel is clean, the service is great and I would recommend the hotel to anyone. Also, Order the typico breakfast- you can't go wrong.  P.S. It was great to meet Roxy. It appears that she is the proprietor"
30,"Our room was pretty much as stated in other reviews. Clean but minimal furnishings and amenities. Hot water in the shower was pretty much non-existent, power only a few hrs a day. Hotel food quality was nothing special and was not exactly cheap either, but then again you are in the jungle minutes away from the most amazing ruins. Wi-fi was very poor, lobby area only and not even close to reliable never mind fast, but then again......you are in the middle of a jungle. Having to pay the park admission just to get to our hotel was not impressive, however It was definitely an advantage to staying in the park in that you can tour around the ruins early in the a.m. and later in the p.m. allowing you to be away from the bus tour crowds.   Waking up in the morning to the sounds of the"
30,"Tikal Inn is a nice hotel in the jungle, 5 minutes walking from the Tikal temples, so the location is just amazing, and it's easy if you want to take the ""early bird"" temple visit. Keep in mind that this is not a normal hotel, so electricity is only between 18.30 and 21, and 6 to 8. There is a wifi connection, that most of the time doesn't work, and a nice swimming pool surrounded by trees and birds, where you can relax after the visits. Breakfast is ok, even though there is no big choice (at least if you have the b&b solution). What I didn't like very much is that when you arrive at the park entrance by car/taxi/bus, which is located 10 km before the hotel, you have to pay the ticket entrance (100 to 150 Quetzal, it depends what time you arrive). So let's say that the same day"
30,"Staying in the park was perfect for our long day exploring the ruins until after sunset, so being able to walk back to our room was nice. However with the park being off grid the power was only on at certain times of the day.  I completely understand the use of generators but i do feel like we were paying for the location only.  The room was decently clean but there were definitely bugs crawling on us at night, which made it hard to sleep.  The shower was almost non existent not providing any pressure and barely spitting out water, I didnt even attempt to actually get in.  But being able to hear the wildlife (howler monkeys) was truly amazing, again LOCATION.  We did stay in the more basic room so maybe next time we visit we would pay a little extra for a more comfortable stay."
40,"Although I think some areas are slightly lacking, this is the place to stay for such easy access to the park. It is literally 60 seconds walk and you wake to howler monkeys, are surrounded by great wildlife and temples. We arrive din the evening and spent a few hours the following morning in the park and then had a swim and went back at teatime again. Could have spent another day there easily. The electricity is cut at night and in the day but made no difference and the fan continues anyway, which surprisingly was enough to keep us cool! There are no actual windows , but thick netting. Nice breeze. When we were there, the pool area was unmanned so towels were piled up and so were the lounger covers. They serve food and drinks there but I assume only in peak season. It would have"
50,"The Jungle Lodge is excellent.  After our tour of Tikal we relaxed by the pool and enjoyed happy hour.  Our room was fantastic, it had a beautiful patio with an outdoor shower and hot tub. The room was very nice and spacious with a modern bathroom. Everything was extremely clean. Although the lights were out at 11 our ceiling fan still ran all night and kept the room cool. The staff was super friendly and fun to chat with as well as provided excellent service. Would definitely recommend the Jungle Lodge.  "
50,This is the perfect location and well worth the stay in the jungle. The rooms were perfect and the best part is the noises of the jungle all night and into the morning. It is close to the park and after a few hours of tours in the heat you can cook off in the pool. The food was great and worth staying to eat here at the lodge. 
50,The room was perfection. The park is staggeringly impressive! Don't even think of staying outside the park.  Waking up to the sounds of the jungle waking up was truly an experience of a lifetime.  We will never forget it!
50,"My boyfriend and I stayed at Jungle Lodge hotel for two nights and we loved it! Our room was very basic and had two double beds. The shared restrooms were close by and very clean each time we used them. Remember, you are in the jungle! You will see bugs! They will be anywhere you go!   We arrived at night and, after traveling all day, headed straight for the restaurant! I ordered the Veracruz Chicken plate and he ordered the Ribeye meal. Both platters were very delicious! We booked a sunrise tour online prior to arriving in Guatemala, so we headed to sleep right after dinner to wake early.  The next morning we woke up and made our way to the lobby/restaurant area for the tour. Keep in mind, the hotel conserves electricity on the off-hours by turning the electricity off. My"
10,"Unhelpful, unfriendly staff. The front desk was incredibly rude on check in and check out and unhelpful with simple requests like if we could have or even buy a plastic bag for wet clothes (we ended up using the one from the trash can). Food was mediocre and the rooms were fine but not worth the awful service. Location cant be beat, but stay at one of the other two hotels in the park!"
30,"We spent one night here. We thought the room was nice.  Clean, spacious, had a nice hammock out front. I did think it was a bit odd that they only had hot water while most people were out doing the sunrise tour, so it was cold showers for us. I don't know if I'd want to spend a week here, but for the night, it was fine.   We did not eat in the restaurant, as it has a fairly limited menu for vegetarians, but the Tikal Inn had decent food. Our favorite place though was the little restaurant across the way for breakfast.   One other note, we booked online but weren't planning on pre-paying. When I e-mailed the hotel to confirm our reservation, they said they would only hold it until 3:00 in the afternoon, unless we pre-paid. Not knowing what time we were going to arrive, we decided"
20,"We planned on staying at the Jaguar Inn two nights originally. We traveled all day, and when we got there were greeted by a rude man at the desk, basically made it seem we were a bother, and would rather we didn't stay there. We had read before that they accept travelers cheques, which there was even a sign hanging in the lobby saying they due. However when we tried to exchange cheques, they just flat out said we don't do that. After asking where we could exchange them anywhere in Tikal, basically said not here. We checked into our room, which was very nice, however extremely overpriced for what you get. We went on our own to find money. We traveled all the way into Santa Elena and went to a bank, came back, and decided to only stay one night due to the service we were getting."
40,"We stayed at the Jaguar Inn in one of the bungalows for a night. When we first arrived, the man at the front desk looked at us and told us they were booked up and had no availability. We insisted we had made a reservation, and my husband had even exchanged an email with someone at the hotel a couple days prior to confirm. The guy insisted they were booked and had no room.  So, after some back and forth and trying to stay friendly about it all, the guy at the front desk actually checked the paper he had in front of him of reservations and saw that our name was indeed on it. I’m not sure if we were discriminated against for some reason or if because we are young and carrying backpacks he thought we wanted to stay at the campsite and it was full... After that, staff treated us fine"
40,"The Jaguar Hotel Tikal staff were helpful prior to and during our trip to Guatemala.  They arranged for our transportation to/from Parrot Nest Lodge, San Ignacio to Tikal, Guatemala along with setting up our Sunrise and Sunset tours with Little Caesar’s Travels (502-5418-4898/5576-1222, littlecaesarstravels@yahoo.com).  Upon arrival to the hotel, the front desk representative didn’t seem to excited to see us, not as friendly and responsive as most other places we stayed.  The hotel, restaurant and grounds are quite nice.   It’s nestled into the wilderness and has a nice ambience.  Each hotel room has a hammock on the porch.  Keep in mind the electric and hot water is limited to a certain number of hours a day.  If not timed right, you may be taking a lot of cold showers or not"
40,"Our signing in to the hotel was ruined by the desk manager, Julio, charging an extra percent on our credit card in the exchange to Q's. That set the tone for our stay. Do your exchange ahead of time so you don't get taken advantage of. Dinner was nice and breakfast of beans was ok. Our room was nice and having the pool available is a life saver. The lodge next to us ran their generator all night which was annoying. Wi fi dosen't work."
50,"We had a marvelous stay at the Tikal Inn.  When one remembers that ""It's a Jungle out there"", the accommodations at the Inn are very nice.  The staff was very helpful, and the meals were good.  We had a Jr. Suite, and a Bungalow, right by the pool.  While it is true that the electricity isn't on for a large part of the day, we weren't usually in the room anyway.  The ruins at Tikal are truly amazing.  I was so glad to stay so close to them and be able to go back in, all by myself and just marvel at the scene."
40,After a long hot day on the Mayan trail climbing temple after temple until you can see clear across the jungle there is nothing better than sipping sangria from the pool side in front of your comfortable villa in the magnificent Tikal national park
30,"The rooms are basic, there is only power for a couple of hours a day.  The bathroom is really basic and not the best, in three days I only got one warm shower. The food is included in the accomodation - you get two selections for breakfast and two for dinner. It is standard fare.  But at the end of the day it is about the Park. Although basic the beds were clean and comfortable, and in the end we were glad to stay there as we had a relaxing time visiting the park at our leasiure. We took a morning visit for sunrise - the guide was inluded in the hotel, although don't be fooled you still have to pay park entry, but as we were the only guests that opted for the mornig tour we had the guide to ourselves which was noice and we had all our questions answered."
30,"Hotel was fine, rooms clean and spacious.  The best feature by far is the pool which is lovely especially after a day exploring the Tikal site.  Restaurant staff nice and did their best but they lack adequate training.  English is limited which is fine as we are after all visiting their country.  However, if you are running a hotel visited by foreign, English speaking tourists you should have staff who can understand English.  If a mistake is made as a result of their limited English management will not take responsibility for the error.  They expect the staff to take the loss which is very unfair.  Management and customer service was really very, very bad.  Any complaints made were completely ignored.  The attitude of the management is their guests are unlikely to return and if"
30,"Located in the jungle at entrance to TIKAL National Park. Due to UNESCO certification, limitations on electricity. Generators supplied limited hours of power and therefore no fans overnight. Had a lemonade drink which made me ill. Food average. Nice pool which was refreshing after visiting the temples "
50,"Tony Ortiz' Jungle Lodge is outstanding. B'fast/lunch/dinner magnificent. Bar setting relaxing and full service. Tony's guides to the ruins in Tikal are educational, in depth, and exciting. Beautiful pool. Rooms have comfortable beds, plenty of hot water, and are super clean."
50,If you want to see the Mayan ruins at Tikal this is the best place to stay.  Individual cabins set in the grounds.  Swimming pool where you can watch the howler monkeys play in the tops of the trees.  Restaurant is good. Staff go out of their way to make your stay memorable.  The ruins are just 10 minutes walk and easily accessible.  Staying here made our trip. If you stay in Flores it takes 1hour up to get to Tikal. Staying here is a fantastic experience. 
30,"The best thing about the hotel is that it is right at the start of the path to the ruins at Tikal. This meant we could get up and go first thing. We travelled as a family, 2 adults and two young kids, so we got a suite. The room was super nice, clean, modern bath, tasteful decor, and windows that looked right out onto the trees. We felt we were immersed in the jungle which was awesome, you gotta like being in the jungle to enjoy it, which we did, but if you don't, then stay elsewhere. Electricity is off at night so must bring a flashlight to walk to the restaurant when it's dark, kind of an adventure! What we did not enjoy so much was the food at the restaurant, and it's the only option around. All was very heavy and greasy, no kid friendly options that weren't fried. Service"
40,"We were nervous about staying here as there were lots of mixed reviews.  We ended up getting a premium room, so it was nice and spacious with basic amenities, hot water, mosquito net, etc).  The facts:  wifi is spotty (you're in the jungle, get over it), food is on the pricier side (you're paying for the convenience of staying INSIDE a park, accept the smaller portion size food and higher price), no electricity after 10pm (the fan and lights will shut off - this is the case for all the other properties inside park), no AC (it will be really difficult to breathe due to the humidity).  Sounds like lots of cons, but those are the facts.  If you want to stay inside the park so you are close to Tikal, I recommend staying here!  It is what it is."
30,I camped one night at the Jaguar Inn while on a recent bike trip. No doubt the location is excellent (right next to the ruins entrance). I did however think that the price was very steep for camping in the off season (at $80 USD the bungalows were not an option for me). I also thought the shower was pretty dirty & found the paid internet to be slow. The food here was good but again pricey. The staff were good and quite helpful but going purely on price I'm not sure I would come back. The ruins are a must see if you are in this part of the world though.
40,"We selected this hotel for our trip to Tikal because it was inside the national park where the ruins are located, and it was a great decision! The hotel is comfortable and just 100 meters form the entrance of the ruins. The rooms are very nice taking in account that there is no electricity during the night, so the rooms (and the ceiling fan) run on batteries during the night. Service was great and the staff was very helpful when we needed a guide for the ruins and transportation to Belize."
30,"So, we went to Tikal, Guatemala. It is in the middle of the jungle, so you have to expect it to be hot and lots of bugs. It was hot in July, and there was no air conditioning - only a ceiling fan which made it difficult to sleep. Other than that, it was a pleasant stay. We did both tours of the ruins at Tikal National Park - the sunset tour when we arrived and then got up and did the sunrise tour, so we were not at the hotel for very long. I traveled in a group of 9 people, so we had 5 of the 13 rooms for the one night we were there. The best part of the stay was that the Inn is inside the National Park, so the only thing we had to do to get to the tour was meet up with our guide and walk."
40,"Likes: great location in park, excellent meals. Rooms very clean and spacious. Staff very helpful. Power will go off at certain times, Wifi best in main restaurant. Use the guides in the park for early morning sunrise tour they will collect you from this hotel. Dislikes: none"
30,"We did the camping here for $25 for 2 people. I'm not sure but it seems like we were charged more than what I read in the guide. However the staff were helpful in keeping our bags for us for the day while we explored the park. The tents have no privacy whatsoever, they are touching, and you have two single beds, so you can't sleep next to your partner. It's also equiped with a sleeping bag but it's so humid that you would prefer a sheet. We did it for the experience but I wouldn't recommend spending more than one night here."
30,"My partner and I booked a poolside bungalow for 1 night. Our room was surprisingly better than we had expected. It was clean and cool inside- I suppose the poolside location allows better airflow through the bungalow? We both slept fine through the night.  Service is average. Food was below average. You are definitely paying for the location. We booked a sunrise tour of Tikal with Roxy (highly recommended!), so staying within TIkal National Park instead of Flores meant we had an extra hour of sleep. This was more important for us.   I feel that the hotel needs to improve their food, replace towels (they are getting a bit old and discoloured. New towels would make a huge difference), improve WiFi, and then maybe perhaps it would have been better value for money."
30,Overall its a little expensive for what you get but its also got a preferential location. Rooms are ok. This hotel really is all about the location.  Shuttle will pick you up at Flores airport in the morning. It goes back at 3pm if you have a flight or other travel plans.  Food was average. Service was decent.
40,"Hotel Tikal Inn is between the ruins and downtown. We slept well, had large rooms with terrace and hammocks. The restaurant is good, we enjoyed eating in the open. Nice swimming pool, very little guests. They arranged transportation for us."
50,"Our stay began with a nighttime arrival via van through the park - once through the main park gate it's still a 20min ride to the hotel. Even though we arrived very late, (bring snacks) the staff was there to greet us and bring us to our thatched roof bungalow. Electricity is only available in the rooms for 2 hours in the am and two at night (6-8? Or thereabouts) Bring headlamps. You can always charge devices in the hotel lobby and wifi is free and available throughout most of the hotel/grounds. Bring cash (there are no ATMs and only hotel takes cards) for tours/park day long entry fee and museums.  The museums are small but still interesting.  Don't be spooked by the sounds of howler monkeys at first break of light. The hotel is very attractive and sports the only in-ground"
50,"Just spent two very pleasant and comfortable nights at the Tikal Inn.  Would not hesitate to go back!  Immediately noticeable is that the Tikal Inn is well-managed.  The staff is well-trained and efficient.  The facility is clean and well-maintained.  While I was there, they were replacing all of the mattresses with new Serta products.  A very pleasant stay in a beautiful location made all the better by the hospitality and efficiency of the staff.    A special thank you to Dr. Roxy Ortiz, who has been a co-manager for the past few years after spending over 30 years as one of the best known guides at Tikal.  She is a wealth of information and graciously was willing to spend quite some time with me sharing her deep knowledge and love of Tikal.  Please note that the Tikal Inn has"
40,"We were very pleasantly surprised by this hotel. Our room (#8) was updated and had 2 full size beds, plenty of space and a very well equipped bathroom. Electricity is shut off during certain hours of the day but overhead fan and 1 outlet still work so it's OK. The pool and pool area are very nice and relaxing, as are the hotel grounds which are nicely landscaped and well cared for.  Others have mentioned that it can be quite hot in the rooms and I have to agree. There is no way to control the speed of the overhead fan and we wished we could have turned it up! But, all in all, the location is so worthwhile to help you maximize your time in the ruins that these little things can be overlooked.  One downside for us was that on the 2nd day we were there (which happened to be a"
50,"We spent two nights and it was fantastic. We arrived early the first day and this allowed us to go explore the Mayan site straight away. By lunch time the temperature were crazy so we walked back, had lunch by the pool and went back out later in the day. We did the same the next day.  To have electricity on part of the day wasn't an issue, we charged what we needed to charge in the evening and that was all we needed. If you need luxury it might not be the place for you but if the interest is Tikal, you will be just a few hundred metres from the start of the trail so perfect location."
50,"The Jungle Lodge is a fantastic place to stay if you are visiting Tikal. It's reasonable, clean and thrilling to wake up to the sounds of the jungle. The staff are friendly and helpful. The accommodations are varied so it's a good place for all kinds of budgets. "
30,"This lodge is generally fine, but very basic. In the heat of Tikal no air condition. Electricity only part of the day, and unpredictable. Very badic food in the restaurant. We stayed 2 nights. I would recommemd to stay one night and try Flores for a second  night in the area."
30,"We went in May. It was a nice room, comfortable, and clean. It had a pool that was really refreshing to cool off after the ruins. It was right next to the entrance to the ruins.   It was special to hear the howler monkeys. They were in a tree right over our lodge. It was really cool But also loud. We also saw spider monkeys, which was neat.  Since we went in May, it was really hot. The fan did help but be aware of the heat.  We didn't eat there because it was expensive and we heard it wasn't great.  Overall, I recommend this hotel. We took a sunrise tour from the hotel with tony. He knew a lot!"
30,"Like most people, we were looking for a hotel for one night while in the park. We didn't want to shell out twice as much money for the place down the road, so we booked the Jaguar Inn. Even though it was the cheaper hotel, it was still pretty pricy at $96 for a room with four beds. The beds were comfortable enough, and we knew about the power and water regulations, so that didn't bother us. The thing that bothered us most was that it wasn't very clean. The linen was a little old, and the floor hadn't been swept or vacuumed before we arrived. For the amount they charge, they could at least have cleaned the room better. The service at the front desk, however, was excellent.  All in all, I would stay there again, but just for the one night that is necessary to see the park and"
40,"We stayed here for one night at the end of July.    The good: The hotel itself is nice, cobblestone pathways to the individual bungalows. Our bungalow was attached to the one next to it, and there were guests there but noise was never an issue.  Our room was spacious, and the beds and pillows were decently comfortable.  We had a room with a queen and a single.  Staff were amazing. All friendly, eager to help. They gave us a good exchanged rate for American dollars (better than anywhere else we went in Guatemala). Ate breakfast at the restaurant which was delicious, big portions and fair prices.  We did the sunrise tour of Tikal wi a guide named Caesee, through our hotel. I can't compare to other tours but he was amazing.  And he got us going before 4 am so we were the first"
40,"The staff at the Jaguar Inn were exceptional and super friendly, even though I spoke very little Spanish and they spoke little English we could understand each other well enough that everything that I needed was well taken care of.  Yes, the power turns off at 9 PM but it was not really very hot, as a matter of fact, it got cold enough for me to sleep under the covers in July.  The food was excellent the staff went above and beyond in taking care of getting us a ruins tour and zip line tour!  The lodge is nice and the hammocks outside every room were a big plus.  If I ever visit Tikal in the future, I will gladly stay here again.  Plus, you haven't lived until you've been woke up by the sound of the howler monkeys in the morning. Such a great experience!"
40,"We loved staying in the Jaguar Inn for 2 nights while we visited Tikal. It is really great for a jungle lodge. The food was amazing! You are so close to the ruins, and they had a good guide that took us on a Sunrise hike. I would recommend planning on having a day and a half to check out the ruins if you are in shape and gungho."
30,"We stayed two nights at the Jaguar Inn.  The only plus of the hotel is its location, as the rooms are quite basic and definitively not a good value for the price you pay... but is the least expensive option to be close to the ruins and after all, we came to Tikal to enjoy it in full, so we were happy with what we got.  They cut electricity late in the night, so the fan stopped working, which in the hot and humid jungle environment was almost a torture.  It was also a problem when you had to wake up at 3:30 for the sun-rise tour and had to look for a torch in the dark.  Breakfast is not included, and the options expensive and average in taste.  During the day there were some nice birds and wild animals roaming in the premises of the hotel, so that is an extra plus if you stay"
50,"This has been on of the best location we were able to stay in, our adventure was truly awesome starting by very polite and welcoming staff, I have to say their service was one of the best. Our rooms were very clean and had lots of windows were the jungle breeze refreshed our room at night, and the tour guide that they provided was excellent (Henry if I'm not mistaking) food might not have been the best from our whole trip, but it was edible and the burgers were very tasty! We would totally come back to this great place."
50,"My husband and I stayed 2 nights at the Tikal Inn for our visit to Tikal. The Inn is in the park and was comfortable.  There is a restaurant at the hotel where we ate 3 meals.  In addition, because we were leaving early in the morning to go back to Flores, they packed us each a breakfast.  We took a tour of Tikal with Elias from Tikal Inn.  Despite being sick, he was an amazing guide.  The property is beautiful.  There are many tropical birds.  A family of coatis played on the lawn.  When we woke in the morning we could hear the howler monkeys.  We loved this place.  The staff were very accommodating with any requests.  They also arranged transportation both from and back to the airport in Flores.  Can't wait to go back."
40,"My friend and I loved this place.  Our rooms were very clean and the beds very cozy.  It is magical hearing the jungle around you.  We liked that electricity was on only in the morning and night as it allows the jungle sounds to permeate.  After all, that is part of the reason you are in the Mayan biosphere!  Plus, the Windows had screens. The staff was nice and tried very hard to please.  The vegetarian meals are very basic but what a good wine list!  We would return."
40,"Nice hotel our cheap room was so far into the jungle is was ridiculous and the walk to reception in the dark included a Tarantula a cane toad, etc pretty scary ! And theres only power twice a day. But location wise its perfect you are right in the park! And no need to eat expensive hotel food just eat at the comodors around the entrance!"
40,"We had one of the garden view bungalows. It was spartan but clean. It had a ceiling fan, which was nice while the power was on. A bright LED emergency light was provided. There was only one power outlet in the room, which may be a bit of a problem when you are trying to recharge three camera batteries before the lights go out. As it turned out though, you can go to the reception area and use the outlets there. The reception area is also where you can sometimes get a wifi connection. The reception desk seems to have power, but not necessarily internet access, which is why they may at times be unable to access your online reservation. They accept credit cards, and staff are helpful. The inn has a restaurant where the menu is limited, but the service is good. Try the allspice syrup"
50,"I was there the last day of December 2012 and the 1st day of January. They had a wonderful New Years Eve party but sadly when I got there, I was so sleep deprived, I missed the party and that slept! That's how I ended 2012!  A wonderful hotel. Walking distance to the pyramids. Pricy but that's expected. If you'r going to spend time in Tikal, I HIGHLY recommend you just stay in the park, whether it be this hotel or the couple others right next to eachother. And what I loved the most about the room. I didn't see any mosquitos! Wasn't too fond of there not being any mosquito nests but I didn't feel worried there."
40,"Staying here it's a little more expensive than staying in other places like El Remate or Flores but it is definitely worth it, specially if you wish to take the sunrise tour of Tikal. The rooms are very clean and elegant, and the food in the restaurant is very good. After a long day of walking in the park, there's a hammock waiting outside of each room, which is the best way to relax, just remember to bring bug spray. If you're planning on taking the sunrise tour (which I strongly advice), you should definitely stay here, other places from Flores offer the same tour, but it's a long drive and once you're in the park, it's a long walk to the temple so there's a chance you might miss the sunrise, also, ask if Cesar will be giving the tour, he's the best."
50,"This is one of the only three hotels inside Tikal National Park, and believe me you want to stay inside, because the drive in is a long one.  This lodge has clean and comfortable cabana type rooms, or you can pitch a tent in the courtyard.  We stayed in a cabana, and felt comfortable with the fan. No AC but that's not a huge deal, it is the jungle after all, and for as remote as this location is, the amenities are great.  I'll never forget the moment I realized that I'm as far from reality as I can get and I am still doing emails :-).  The restaurant food was very good, super clean.  The staff is SO friendly.  We took the sunrise tour and our guide was knowledgeable and a real pleasure.  He greeted us with coffee and cookies at our 4AM departure time.  The sunrise tour was"
40,"I stayed 2 nights at the Jaguar Inn during my visit to Tikal. With just a 5 minute walk to the start of the ruins at Tikal the location can't be beat. After seeing Tikal we were too tired to search for a restaurant so we ate at the inn. The food was excellent, and the beer was cold. The bungalow we stayed in had no A/C but the ceiling fan worked well. Not sure why, but they kill the power to the inn between 9pm and about 6:30am so be sure you have a ht shower by then. Overall a great lodge at an amazing site."
40,We were with a G Adventures group and we camped at this place overnight. When we arrived our small tents were set up already with air mattresses and linen ready. We Slept one person to a tent and I think this was the best most comfortable way to sleep here. 2 people to a tent would have been too crowded. The tents were in good shape. I am not sure how well they would do in the rain but I was very comfortable in my tent that night. Bring Earplugs as there is nothing stopping the noise of fellow campers. There was a lot of noise from people who snore. LOL.  The Camp shower looked rough. BUT this was the best shower I had on my trip - plentiful hot water with GREAT strong water pressure. Use the guys shower its the best! Bring a flashlight because they turn the lights off to the
10,"We were very dissapointed, Very rude staff from the moment you arrive.. They want to charge you for every thing in advance , and we were charge again in a credit card used only for reservation purpose...we place a claim and they justified the charges with all kind of things....the rooms were very  far, walking through the jungle and you get no help for your luggage.. No electricity after 9 pm, no wifi, the only good thing was the pool, but we had to beg  for towels!!  "
40,"We stayed in a room towards the foot of the pool, near the restaurant / lobby of the hotel. The room was exactly as described. We had double beds, fans & hot water for a couple of hours in the evening and a couple of hours in the morning.  The room was clean and comfortable.    We booked with a guide from Belize (King David) so he took care of arranging our accommodations as well as the guides for the park.  I'm not sure if that made the difference but our hotel stay, hikes through the park and transfers from the border were flawless.  Loved staying in the park and having the pool available.    Your (screened) windows will be open so you will hear lots of jungle noises and possibly other guests at night. Interesting for a night's stay.  If you are a light sleeper, you may want"
30,"The Hotel Tikal Inn is well maintained and the pool was very much appreciated.  We were there the end of August.  Keep in mind - you ARE in the jungle!  It's blazing hot and humid.  The humidity and heat were beyond anything I have ever encountered, so, the pool was a huge relief, even though it was like bath water.  The restaurant and food were good and the staff are very helpful and friendly.  The rooms are clean and cute.  I can't say the beds were the best, but, not horrible either.  The biggest drawback is there was no A/C and they turn off the electric about 9:00 at night, so, even if you bring a fan, if it's electric, no fan!  We all took cold showers before power went off and just went to bed and played on our phones.  The location is great though.  You can walk to the"
30,I stayed one night in order to get a good look at the ruins. It is an easyish walk . I am an older adventurer.  I walked into the park 3 separate times at different times of day. That was spectacular. Loved the spider monkeys ... The feeling of being alone in the jungle and among the ruins was great. Food at Tikal Inn was uninspired but fine. The bungalow was very nice.
30,"We wanted to take the sunrise tour, so stayed in the park one night. We had a room at the end of the property, about 150 meters from the office. Walking along a soft path of wood shavings into the jungle at night was interesting. We had arrived about 4 pm and took a quick tour of the ruins with a guide, then dinner, then out to see our room. It was small but clean and has screens. We knew there is only electricity from 6 pm til 9 pm, so were not surprised. There was still running water for a shower to cool off before bed. There is a small LED light to get dressed by in the morning. The sunrise tour departed at 4 am. The surprise was that special park tickets costing 100 quetzals each are needed for that tour. At 4 in the morning, it was actually almost cool outside. It was"
40,"This is my 3rd trip to Tikal, my first staying here at the Jungle Lodge, the others at the Jaguar Inn.  I cannot recommend enough to everyone to stay in the Park instead of in Flores if you truly want to experience the solitude of the ruins before and after the tour bus crowds. We stayed in a hostel room which served our purposes and were cheap compared to the other options here.  The shared bathrooms were nice and clean.  My only complaint being is the room was god awful hot this time of year.  As others say the power goes off at 1000 and then you are left to suffer and sweat it out. I literally cannot recall another night spend so hot and miserable, but the Park is so magical its worth it.  I recommend trying to get a room on the corner so you can get some cross ventilation"
40,"The hotel itself is a wonderful place to get away from the modern world. There is very limited technology and hours for electricity are limited but the setting is beautiful. I enjoyed sitting on our patio or at the pool and watching nature in its element. It was right outside the Tikal National Park so it was a perfect place to go after an all day adventure. The food at the restaurant is mediocre, but it isn't horrible. The staff is super hospitable and accommodating.  Our room was beautiful,  we stayed in a suite and had a patio and outdoor shower. The one thing I would advise, is that you need to come with cash and all the cash you plan to need for your stay.  To enter the park itself, it costs 150 quetzales per person (foreigners) per day. The maps are another 20 quetzales"
50,"Beautiful hotel just meters beside the wild life, the forest and INCREDIBLE BEAUTIFUL TIKAL!  The Mayan Piramids are AMAZING! I have been in Egypt and Tikal is just as beautiful as Egipt, but even more with the forest sorrunding you!! Monkeys, birds, wild life just in front of you!! "
20,"Disappointed by my stay at Jungle Lodge. No complimentary drinking water for hostel guests (10Q a small bottle and you will go through a lot), hostel guests unable to open a tab for food and drinks, fans go off at 10pm making for a very uncomfortable night's sleep (I realise electricity is constrained in the jungle but this was not an issue for the more expensive bungalows, nor at Jaguar Inn apparently), pool was so dirty it was unusable (some jungle debris expected but it was filthy), food in restaurant was very disappointing (my ravioli, clearly dried and from a packet was still hard in the middle). The room was fine and yes, location was very good, but I would avoid staying here if you can. And expect to be treated worse if staying in the cheaper rooms."
50,"The hotel location, staff & facilities are perfect for a before or after trip to Tikal. But the highlight for me was the sunrise/architectural tour. Francesco was an informative and engaging guide for the full 7 hours of the tour. I would highly recommended this tour & good value for money too. "
50,"Very comforting staff. big restaurant. My double room was located beside the shared toilet area which I didn't like so much, so El Kevin (staff) gave me pretty much the best room in that price segment without hesitating. A lot of jungle around. Bed and pillow high quality. Toilets and showers spotless."
20,"We had several major problems with this hotel, which considering it was the most expensive place we stayed in during our Guatemalan trip, were unacceptable.   We tried to contact the hotel four or five times before arriving in Flores to see if it was possible to arrange some sort of pick up service/how to get to the hotel. Despite emailing and calling we had no luck in speaking to anyone. Our bus to Flores arrived at around 5pm, and we had to get a taxi for two hours in the dark to the hotel, which wasn't a particularly comfortable experience as most of the drive is through very quiet jungle.  On arriving, we were told that we could not do the sunrise tour (the only reason we were staying at the hotel) as we were too late to get a ticket for the morning. No apology for the lack"
50,"We stayed as ""hostel-patrons"" this means less expensive, smaller room en shared bathroom. Everything was clean though. The restaurant is good and not really more expensive than the rest in the 'hood and defenitely better value for money. Really nice personnel, payment is possible with credit card. Be advised, electricity only until 10pm (generator in the jungle). Check out possible at 5h50AM, so you can enter the park at 6AM (DO IT). WiFi was out at the moment of our visit and unfortunately no airco in ""hostel-mode."" No breakfast included though. I would recommend this lodgingoption."
50,"stayed here as an add on to our holiday, we had one of the newer bunglalows on the edge of the property and it was very nice and light and airy, lovely rainforest shower and nice size bathroom, a little verandah which looked out over the forest where we sat and watched monkeys feeding in the trees.  The restaurant served a nice breakfast and evening meal, didn't have lunch there.  wonderful location as you are only steps away from the ruins. walking back in later in the day when the crowds had gone was a bonus."
50,"Great service at check in and the restaurant. Great food in the restaurant too. Rooms are spartan but clean and comfortable. We felt the price was very reasonable. Bathrooms had hot water. Power is turned off at night (10pm-5:30am) and in the middle of the day, but this wasn't a problem for us at all. Being able to stay within walking distance of the ruins allowed us to get up early and visit them before the heat and crowds arrived, which was a HUGE plus. Probably the best place we stayed on our modestly-budgeted trip through Guatemala."
30,"We chose to stay inside the National Park for convenience - easy to get out early for ruins or birdwatching and to come back to for half an hour or so in the middle of the day. Good decision. Rooms simple but clean and adequate. Shower hot. All very convenient - everything very accessible. Lunch time/afternoon seemed to be full of braying British public school girls or loud Israeli, Canadian and American backpackers all vying to tell each other about their latest escapade (and showing off their bare chests, men only, ignorant of the fact that is not a polite thing to do). Must be getting old but it was a little annoying having to listen since there was no escape. Evenings better - a hum of conversation but no braying/shrieking.  Would I stay there again? Yes."
40,"Had a fabulous three day stay at Jaguar Inn in Tikal.  The bungalow was clean and basic, nothing fancy, with no a/c but the ceiling fan did the trick for us.  The staff always addressed any concerns we had about the room in a timely manner. The restaurant had good food and much appreciated a/c at lunchtime. The menu was small, but had some interesting choices with a more local flair than the more expensive hotel next door.   They offer guided tours of the ruins and nature (including sunrise and sunset tours).  Although we did not take advantage of these (prefer to wander on our own) other guests said the guided tours were enjoyable and informative.   Lots of great birding throughout the park or even in the parking areas.  You can't beat staying right in the park."
20,"We booked the hotel for two nights in Tikal. After seeing the room, we dropped the second night: not clean, bed sheets verly likely not fresh, the toilet was leaking. I know Guatemala since nearly 15 years and this is not typical for Guatemala, even more for this price range. Better to stay in El remate for half the price and enjoy much better hotels there plus the 30 minutes bus trip to Tikal.  The restaurant is o.k., the people are also friendly but the room was sort of a disaster."
30,We stayed at Hotel Jaquar for one night.  We did a sunset tour of Tikal and a sunrise tour of Tikal.  We had dinner at the hotel which was good.  The staff were pleasant.  Our room was clean but very basic.  It had old school bed spreads which always make me nervous since I'm a germ phobe.  The hot water was only on certain hours of the day and turned off at 9pm.  The electricity turned off at night which meant the ceiling fan stopped operating too.  Candles were provided in case you needed to get up in the middle of the night.  Bring flashlights.  Tikal is the attraction here.  The hotels are not.
30,"After a long tour in Tikal, the Jaguar Inn, inside the park, is a natural spot to want to have lunch or a cold beer, and if you happen to have your laptop with you, surf the web while you wait for your tour bus to leave.  Unfortunately, their beer is warm and they charge $10Q to use the wifi, even if you are ordering. I have no problem paying if I'm not ordering anything, but I think it's tacky to charge paying guests.  There bathrooms, however, are nice and clean, and the ambiance is pleasant."
10,"I was extremely displeased with pretty much my entire stay at this place. They pretended that they didn't have our reservation so our guide had to talk to the desk guy for almost an hour. I'm a white guy with lots of tattoos and gauges in my ears so I know I look a bit different but these people didn't stop staring at me, eating, drinking, walking around I was intently watched the entire time. Maybe it's a cultural thing, who knows but it made me very uncomfortable the entire time. The food was very sub par. They made a huge stink about food vouchers even though we had cash. They also charged 7 U.S. for a beer which cost less than 3 U.S. outside this place. All the whispering and staring and laughing from the staff made it a terrible experience. The rooms only have power for a"
40,"My husband and I had a great time staying at the Tikal Inn. It's a short walk to the park, and we stayed there in order to take the sunrise tour, which I highly recommend. Though it was too overcast to actually see the sunrise, walking in the jungle listening to the howler monkeys and other wildlife waking up is amazing.   Later in the day we took a longer tour of the park with Jose Luis Zecena - his email address is: guideoftikal@gmail.com and we really enjoyed it. We spent all day exploring the ruins. Jose Luis pointed out many birds and animals, as well as gave us a lot of information about the ruins.It was a very thorough tour and we saw many buildings off the beaten path. Jose Luis is very enthusiastic about his job and we enjoyed spending the day in Tikal!"
30,We booked thru Guatemala Travel in Antigua (never ever use them) we asked for one room and they charged us for two.. Not ok and they would not fix it... They put us in a room over the septic tank ... We smelled waste all night long.. We are talking raw sewage...they only have power for a few hours in the morn and a few hours at night... so our room smelled like HOT POOP! Good times.. The room was spotless and the grounds were lovely..
50,"The hotel is really nice. Obviously there are inconvenience with not having hot water 24 hours or light 24 hrs, but well is in a jungle you cannot ask much. The food and beverage are really good and big.  Perfect place to go as a couple or with family or friends."
10,"I have been to Tikal before, but never stayed in the park.  I arranged this hotel through a package put together with a tour operator I use for all of my travel in Guatemala and Chiapas, Mexico, and I know that the horrible service I received at the Hotel Tikal Inn was not his fault.  Simply put they work with shuttle drivers who will switch reservations at the last minute at the airport, so a solo traveler or pair who has a reserved ride will get switched off to a vehicle with a crack on the windshield and no speedometer.  This kind of behavior on the part of the hotel management and unethical shuttle drivers is what sets tourists up for theft in Peten.  At the hotel there was no electricity for the fans at night, and the best part is that our REAL shuttle driver arrived an"
30,"Given that we had wanted to do a sunrise tour, and then explore Tikal at leisure, we were very happy we decided to stay overnight at Jungle Lodge as it is minutes away from the Park. The beds are comfy but at $150 a night (Junior Suite) it was a little expensive. Rooms are small, a bit dark and only fan-cooled so was rather hot and uncomfortable to stay for too long during the day. Note also is no wifi in the rooms, and in the dining area the connection is very slow so don't expect to be able to surf much. The hotel is full of tour groups so dining room can be noisy and service slow. We were glad to stay only one night. However for location it was perfect, esp as the weather at this time of year is very hot (40 degrees C) so it really makes sense to explore the park very early,"
50,"We have justo checked out after a night at this wonderful lodge inside a Unesco heritage park.  On arrival, our driver forgot to give us our tickets for exploring the Park the next day, and panic set in.  The only way we could communicate with our travel agent to get the driver to return with the tickets was by email as there is no cell service in the jungle.  Kevin, the front desk manager, agreed to sell us extra tickets which calmed us tremendously.  In the end, our driver returned and Kevin refunded us for the tickets that we didn't need after all.  Cheers to Kevin!  We should also mention that we had good food and drinks in the lodge, and the Park is definitely worth visiting.  Enjoy your visit here!"
50,"We were on a week tour around Guatemala and when we finally arrived in Flores and Moses the shuttle driver for Jungle Lodge was waiting for us I could have kissed him.  He was helpful, professional and when he saw I was trying to photograph a sunset he stopped the shuttle and waited.  Our junior suite was beautiful.  The beds were very comfortable and we even had a bathtub.  Nothing like relaxing in a hot tub after a ten hour bus ride.  The food was good and service impeccable.  Sitting on the porch I was able spot several varieties of birds.  We went to Tikal in the morning and in the afternoon walked back to the hotel for a swim in the pool.  Later we walked back to the park to catch the sunset.  It was amazing.  We were booked her for two nights and I wish we could have"
40,"I say 'surprisingly good' because I wasn't expecting much. The cabins are set in lovely jungle 'gardens' and the service at reception was very good - friendly and helpful. Power is not available 24/7 but this was explained at the outset and we didn't have any problems. The only issue is that food from the kitchen served in the restaurant was not served hot enough but the food was nice so that was a bit sad. But apart from that, restaurant and bar service was excellent. There was a high level of English spoken which was surprising."
50,"JUNGLE LODGE resort – Tikal, Guatemala, nights of Jan. 24-27, 2017 (5 stars) This place is fantastic and the staff and service are great. Very nice cabins with two back-to-back rooms. The only drawback is that you could hear your neighbors in the next room, especially if you were in the bathroom. Like most other places, although there were two of us, only one cabin key was available, but if we both went out but not together, the key could be left at reception for whoever came back first. The lodge is very close to the entrance to the archaeological park (“Tikal ruins”), which is very handy. The resort is also in the jungle, so monkeys were in the trees outside in the morning (and monkey poop on our doorstep!). The restaurant in the lodge serves very good food and has reasonable"
10,"Receptionist and manager have terrible customer service and lie to you about transportation options, non-existent wifi and a per minute charge for phone use, bad food, and no laundry service (even though it is advertised), rooms are a little run down. I understand that because it is in the middle of the jungle, you will not get all the luxuries of a conventional hotel (no hot water or electricity during the day, no wifi, etc), but their customer service was appalling.    First of all, when I was waiting in the lobby, some customers came in who had been waiting at the Belize border for the hotel's private shuttle, but the shuttle never showed up. They ended up having to taxi from the border to the hotel.  When the receptionist looked into this and realized that he had forgotten"
40,"Overall, the place was comfortable. Everything was clean..I checked our sheets every night to make sure there were no spiders after reading one of the reviews for this place :). There's really not much up there around Tikal, so it's kind of you get what you get. The staff all seemed friendly and helpful enough, we both speak very little spanish, but between our bad spanish and the staff's ok english it worked out fine. Make sure you bring Guatemalan money. We didn't realize there are no ATM's once you get into the park so when our bus got to the point where you get off and go right to Tikal or stay on the bus and go left into Flores we had to take the bus into Flores to an ATM and then get a private shuttle up to Tikal which was a little bit of bummer, waste of time and money."
50,"We stayed at Tikal Lodge. We really recommend that you stay at Tikal  because that way you can visit Tikal first thing in the morning when it’s cool and quiet. Then, as you leave, you will meet the crowds arriving. Whilst they go round in the heat of the day, you have a siesta and a swim. (We should have visited the museum then).  In the afternoon you visit again (it's a large site), arriving as the crowds are leaving. In the peacefulness you are more likely to see, as we did, howler monkeys, spider monkeys, coatimundi and foxes. We recommend Roxy as a tour guide.See Roxy Ortiz Tikal Tours for our review.  Tikal Inn is very nice, clean, and has good food. Great to have the pool."
20,"We were handled by Receptionist Villavicencio. First, he tried to convince us that we made the reservation for 2 days instead of one. We had to prove him wrong. Then he tried to convince us that 'special price' through Booking.com is valid only if we purchase additional items - Sunrise Pkg and Meal pkg. At the end he charge us extra for our 10 yrs old daughter although she was included in the reservation we made through Booking.com. He gave us (in almost empty hotel) the most distanced room and we had to carry our luggage as far as possible. Practically no Wi-Fi, electricity only for 2-3 hrs in the morning and the night."
40,"If you want to get up close and personal with nature and be based in the national park at Tikal, this is a great choice of accommodation. The best part about it? Hearing the Howler Monkeys in the middle of the night and all of the other fascinating sounds of the forrest. The rooms are simple and very clean, and most are set around a large pool, which is all we could think about after a hot day exploring the ruins and surrounding landscape. As the electricity runs off a generator rooms have no access to power except for three hours in the morning and 3 hours at night. This didn't bother us in the slightest as we were out all day anyway. If you can take the deal that includes dinner, breakfast and a free sunrise tour DO IT. The food was delicious and the sunrise tour remains a"
50,My husband and I stayed here in March for one night. We had arrived by private shuttle around 9:45 am so we were hoping to leave our bags with the front desk so we could begin exploring. It was such a nice surprise that we were able to check in on the spot. The check in process was quick and Jonathan at the front desk explained when the electricity was available and made sure we understood in park fees we would need to pay.   We had opted to treat ourselves to a bungalow room and were given Bungalow B6 which faced the pool. The room was spacious and squeaky clean with a ceiling fan as well as a small battery operated light so during hours with no electricity you do not have to be in total darkness. The night we were there someone must have forgot to turn off the generator
30,"If the Jaguar Inn was anywhere but at the gates to Tikal you'd pay $20/night not the $80+ they get away with. Not that it's that bad - just desperately overpriced for what you get.   Positive points: location, spacious room,  plentiful hot water and electricity in spite of what the blurb in the rooms says and surprisingly good food in the restaurant.   So-so points: spartan unwelcoming decor, questionable cleanliness, marginal wifi (room 1A), on the noisy side.    Negative points: vastly overpriced, staff mostly couldn't care less - although a couple of them were ok. Lumpy old bed.   In general suffers from lack of competition. There are only 3 places at the gates to Tikal so they can pretty well do what they like. "
50,"just what you need for a stay near Tikal - its right at the entrance so no bus trip from Flores or San Ignacio -& a better hotel than all inside San Ignacio town (the high end ones outside San Ignacio are fine but you can't do a morning visit to Tikal like at Jaguar. Why not be right there? Restaurant was just o.k. and reasonable priced - WI-FI was not the best, but sufficient. Smoothie was just o.k.  Apparently people eat at the three different restaurants regardless of where they stay the night, but Tikal Inn smoothie was no good at all and twice the Jaguar price - in fact the other places were more expensive and not at all any better. Jaguar rooms have only fans that are one speed - high- so not comfortable and since electricity is an issue after the generator goes off"
30,We stayed at Jaguar Inn only to see the sunrise and sunset tours. Our room (number 9 I think) was clean and serviceable.  We never had an issue was electricity or hot water our shower got backed up after one shower and NEVER drained. Given that all we did was sleep there for 6 hours it wasn't a big deal but given that it was sandwiched in between two luxury stays this was really akin to camping for us. The free wifi was great and readily available and the location can't be beat for the proximity the paths to the sites of TIKAL.
30,"the hotel is kinda expensive for what is offered ,but location is perfect cause u can walk to pyramids after breakfast...you must walk out at night to see all the stars--amazing!!!  the power turns on and off all night and we didnt even get electricity until 10am the next day..the rooms were just ok but what made the difference was the staff!!! in general, guatemalans are a very friendly helpful culture-but not here!!! the front desk guy DOMINGO was soo unhelpful with any questions we asked and was truly jaded by tourist..you could tell he did not want to be there..the other staff was not much better..food was delicious though..if ur in a rush like us for one day in tikal then maybe check out the other hotels next door"
20,"We booked two standard rooms with private bathrooms at US $ 300 including breakfast and dinner. The rooms were extremely simple and no cooling or electricity at all after 9:30. Our room was also bug infested. I know its the jungle, but for the price, especially in Guatemala, you should expect more. I honestly think a tent would have been better. The guy at the lobby also sold us dinner plus a tour for a ridiculous exchange rate and tried to sell us a transfer back to the Belizean border for US $ 10 per person more than we wound up paying by simply walking 5 min into the parking lot.   On the plus side, the guided morning tour was given by a park archeologist who was very knowledgeable. That was arranged by the hotel. The pool is also a plus after a long morning hike. "
40,This hotel has a great location right next to the archaeological site.  The pool and garden are nice and well maintained.  Rooms a bit tired and felt damp and only very limited power/hot showers - generally when you're out at the ruins.  Food on the meal plan wasn't great.  Staff friendly.  Sunrise tour good to get in and see the temples.  Wifi intermittent.  Overpriced for quality of room - but you're not paying for the hotel - you're paying for the location.  Would stay again.
30,"As far as location is concerned this is fantastic. Really close to the archaeological sight, which is why we were there. However, the room was pretty poor. The beds weren't up to much and there was a hole in my pillow case.  The food was pretty rough. I was only there one night and didn't stick around "
20,"The positives first: the hotel has a nice garden and a beautiful pool area. Our room was substandard, they also have better, more expensive options, but our standard room was very basic for the price. We also booked the sunrise tour to the Tikal temples which was great! However, the receptionist refused to call another hotel for a change of the reservation and also lied to us with regards to the collectivos just because he wanted to sell us his transfer to Flores. All in all not a great choice but the location in the Tikal park compensates for everything."
50,"The room was quiet, dark and extremely comfortable in bed.  Loved the front porch to the room where we would sit and review the day.  Lots of birds and wildlife surrounding the hotel.  We had a bungalow and it was quiet and homey.  Our first morning we heard something that sounded as if the earth was breathing.  There was no other sound and it was human.  It was amazing!  Enjoyed the painting on the walls in the lobby/dining room of the hotel.  Also liked the local band that played on Sunday night."
40,"The hotel was fine, nice rooms and hot water for showers during most of the hours that you would likely want it.  I think sunrise would be better than sunset, but the early morning tour enters the park at 4 am and sunrise wasn't until about 6:00.  Not worth the extra 100 quetzales in my eyes.  My friend and I found a group that was guided in English just inside the gate, and that guide offered to have us join the group for half price.  Also, note to see the sunset you will likely have to climb up templo 4 and bribe the guard with 20 quetzales, in order to go around the baricade and climb the scafolding on the side that faces the sunset."
30,"We stayed here for 2 nights. We booked the transfer from Flores through the hotel. The hotel is located right outside the entrance to Tikal National Park, so location can't be beat. The room was pretty basic but clean. The following day we returned to the room during the afternoon after lunch, and it still wasn't clean. I had to remind the front desk to clean it up. The food was pretty good but a bit expensive - I guess that's what happens when there is not much choice around. For lunch, we actually found a local lady serving up pretty good tamales. Overall, it's a decent place to stay if you want to get an early start in the park."
40,"Overall, the hotel was a good experience. It is located on Tikal property, thus enabling easy entry and exit of the park, and the service was pretty good. The only complaint I would have about my stay at the hotel was that when I was getting into bed for the evening, I discovered a fairly large spider in the bed too. Given that the hotel is located in the jungle, this might be expected, nevertheless, it was a harrowing experience to find the unexpected companion."
20,"We wanted to stay next to the ruins in Tikal.   The Jaguar Inn made us jump through hoops to make reservations and required That we pay in advance. We paid for 4 nights and once we got there,we were eaten alive by bed bugs the first night. When we reported it to hotel staff, they told us  they did not find bed bugs , only mosquitoes. We showed the awful bites to prove there were NOT caused by mosquitoes. They did not clean our rooms everyday.  The only redeeming grace of this awful hotel was the person at the front desk who attenpted to have our room sprayed with a small pesticide  can. The hotel next door, Tikal Inn was cheaper, had much better service and was cleaner. We ended up eating our meals at Tikal Inn and slept outside on hammocks to avoid bed bugs! Before departure,"
40,"Jaguar Inn is a very conveniently located hotel about 2 minutes walk from the entrance to Tikal. I was not interested in staying in Flores and waiting for a morning tour to bring me to Tikal in the morning; I wanted to get up and meditate on top of Temple IV (on the far West of the known structures in the city) at sunrise and the hotel's convenient location easily permits that.  The rooms are a little more expensive than average, although very clean and comfortable. Ask to stay away from the restaurant so you don't get early or late noise from other guests. We enjoyed a room with a view of the garden, on the top floor with a patio outside. We were told that the hot water goes off during certain hours, but it didn't - we had access to hot water in our big bathroom the whole time."
50,"I am not sure if it was just the hunger we worked up hiking around in Tikal, but the meals at the Jungle Lodge were amazingly delicious!  For some reason, I had really low expectations (maybe I had read reviews of other nearby hotels' food), and so I was blown away by the breaded chicken breast and all the soups.  The staff were incredibly kind and helpful with excellent English.  The landscaping is beautiful.  The rooms are simple, but very comfortable—never saw a single insect.  And it's just so close to the entrance to the park!  You can walk right in.  I highly, highly recommend the Jungle Lodge."
40,"Hotel is very accommodating, great pool and very nice staff Very good location very cool and natural setting, spacious restuarant, has Mimi gift shop and they accept $US currency one of the better hotel at the site"
40,"This is not a luxury hotel. Luxury hotels really have no business in the Tikal park, where there is electricity only during the day, and even then sporadically. The hotel, however, handles these limitations deftly.  There is always electricity in the lobby and restaurant, and it doesn't go off in the rooms until10:30. The rooms themselves are very nice, really bungalows with a porch where one can read or rest. The pool is well appointed and provides a great respite from touring the ruins.  Indeed, the great advantage of staying in the park itself, as opposed to Flores or El Remate, is that you can easily get up (as we did) and do a sunrise tour -- the park entrance is literally a 30 second walk from the hotel!  Then you can lounge around the pool during the hottest part of the"
40,"We had booked the hotel inside the park with the intention to check in and relax at the great pool and then go in the park at 3.  However this was changed when we got to the ""entrance"" of the park and were forced to by a pass for that time (before 3pm, this is the time you can use the pass for both days!) or wait till 3pm and then figure out our own way in the rest of 20km from the real entrance. We told the driver we were staying at the lodge and that we wanted to just get dropped there. He just bullied us into buying a ticket or lose the ride we had already paid for into the park with San Juan transit service. We tried to ask the hotel if they can help with fixing this problem of the ticket and they just gave us the same BS all the rest of the park staff did. We did not"
40,"This hotel is in the park and is a great location, the bungalows were very good and waking to the howler monkeys an experience and having a pool to cool down in after a day wandering was a treat. We weren't so keen on the restaurant as the food and service was very mixed. Some staff were great, some less so and the food had a touch of canteen food. All that said this is a great place to stay."
40,"Despite the redundant name for this place, the Hotel Tikal Inn is probably the best place to stay in the park. We stayed there a total of five nights to provide adequate time to go to Tikal, Uxacatun, Yaxha, the museums, and nearby ziplining. There is limited power by park regulation, so bring your flashlights, and use the time available to charge devices. Wifi is slow and better in the lobby area. Rooms are sparse but clean, with fans for when the power is on.  But to beat the heat, the pool and a cold Gallo are really the amenities to have at the hotel. None of the other hotels offer a pool. The bird watching is really good from the pool area, with toucans, oropendula, turkeys, and parrots all around. We also saw agouti, anoles, and scorpions, so wear shoes at night.    The"
40,"You want to take the sunrise tour. You want to see Tikal before the parking lot fills up with buses. So you're going to choose one of three hotels within the park. Compared to anywhere else you are likely to stay in Guatemala, it's going to be expensive relative to what you get. BUT: The pool is lovely. The menu is extensive and the food is great. The bungalows are comfortable at night even without electricity to run the fan. Yes, the wifi is spotty. Yes, a private shuttle from the airport (if it doesn't coincide with what seem to be their daily runs to meet the overnight buses) costs $60 US. But they still make it a very worthwhile experience. There was coffee ready at 3:45 for the 4 a.m. tour. Jorge the shuttle driver is happy to stop at an ATM on the way to or from the"
30,"We stayed at Tikal Inn to be able to watch the sunset at the park and wake up early the next day. For this purpose the hotel was fine. However, we payed $75USD, a deal we found on Booking.com, and for this money I though the room was very mediocre. If this wasn't at the park you would pay $30USD for this hotel anywhere else in Guatemala. "
30,"Location, Location, Location - for the cost, the Tikal Inn is expensive and the facilities poor - the bedrooms have no airconditioning, the sheets are worn, the beds uncomfortable.  The restaurant options are limited and the service is unfriendly.  However, all of this pales into insignficance when you get inside Tikal itself.  The ruins are magical and by staying here (or at the nearby Jungle Inn or Jaguar Inn) you can visit the site at sunset and sunrise."
50,The location is perfect. The tour guide I had was fantastic and was fun to talk to during thr tour. The pool was nice. The only thing to keep in mind is they only have power between 6 and 9pm. The food was a bit expensive.
50,"We wanted a nice place close to the park and this place totally fit the bill.  Very nice cabins, amazing bathrooms and comfortable bedding all made our visit wonderful.  The park entrance is about a three minute walk and the restaurant they have was amazing.  Outstanding choices and well-prepared and served by a more than friendly staff.   We also loved our guide picking us up personally at the airport in Flores.  He was so knowledgeable about the park and very easy to understand.    I highly recommend this place."
20,"The location is very good. Staff are friendly and helpful. Expect now power during the day and night. Why is this important? There is no AC. So it means the fans don't work at night. It is hot and warm. We did not sleep well because of it. The least they could do is ensure the fans work! If you can sleep in hot places - might not be an issue for you. Drinks and food are expensive - think New York City, Paris, etc. - and it isn't that good for the price."
40,"The staff was extremely friendly, effective and accommodating. The restaurant let us borrow two bowls and glasses so we could eat breakfast in our room at a very early hour before the restaurant opened at 6:30. They also let us bring our own wine into the restaurant with no corkage fee. We accidentally forgot to tip our waiter on the first day, so the next day they made special arrangements to get our tip to him though he wasn't working that day.  The quality of food at the restaurant was surprisingly good and reasonably priced considering the challenges of being in a national park that is so far away from a city. I've eaten at restaurants throughout the world in similar situations that served far worse food that was more expensive.  The room was exactly as advertised including"
40,"Our room was airy, spacious and pleasant. We weren't at the lodge much as the day, evening and early morning was spent at Tikal. The swimming pool was welcome after a day walking around the ruins.  No electricity much of the time but it wasn't needed. Being close to the ruins is a definite plus. Great being able to walk early in the morning to the ruins. Earlier reviews made me think the food wouldn't be good, but it was."
50,"This hotel enjoys more than the best spot in Tikal. It has a great pool area where you can cool down whilst the park is too hot or too busy. The best times to visit the park is early morning and after 3pm when it has cleared of the main bulk of day visitors,you will see more animals and enjoy most monuments all by yourself. We saw many birds including parrots and toucans there are plenty of spider monkeys  and howler monkeys and other animals. We stayed 3 nights and had time to explore everywhere even off the beaten track. Although be aware that there are deadly snakes. The pool snacks are great but the restaurant is not fantastic, the first night we did not get a seat as it was to fully booked but there is another restaurant off site called the commodore which (actually) is"
40,The Jaguar Inn (or any of the hotels in the park) is the best and only way to truly experience the wonder of Tikal. What is so great about Tikal is that you can pretty much spend as much time as you want exploring the park without anyone bothering you. The jaguar Inn is located steps from the park entrance and has very nice rooms for Guatemala. We paid $80 per night and we would definitely stay. Our room was 1C. It was on the 2nd floor of one of the buildings and the room was very comfortable and quiet. There is a fan and 3 beds in this room and the shower has hot water. The best part of staying in the park is that you get to experience the jungle at night and hear all of the animal sounds. My only complaint about the place was the front desk receptionist Domingo. He was the
30,"As you arrive at the main gate of the park (which is on the highway), each visitor must pay the entrance fee ($22US as of Dec 2012), then it's another 5 to 8 minute drive before you come to the area where the hotels are located. Also near the hotels is the entrance gate & another ticket booth to the ruins, several souvenir stands, an area where a museum is located along with another restaurant (not part of the hotels) and a scaled diorama of the ruins. Near the diorama is a pond, with a resident alligator.       All three hotels are within the national park boundry with the Jaguar Inn as the  least expensive. This hotel also has a very small campground behind the restaurant and next to one of the hotel rooms. {There's another larger campground across the parking lot with a few"
30,"The rooms are clean and in good condition. This place is not cheap at all. The food prices are expensive, I paid for a Spagetti Bolognese around Q80 and it was a very small portion. Breakfast was not included in the price. One has to pay for the internet connection too. As there are not many options in the national park, it is still an okay place to stay."
50,"the hotel is locate couple meter from the entrence of the park. The room are not fency but remember , you are in the middle of the jungle. Good restaurant wit internet. Batroom is clean. I had 3 bed in my room. Liitle balcony ."
20,"The Jaguar Inn is situated right outside of Tikal National Park.  While the beds are comfortable, and the food decent, the management and staff seem to have little regard for guests.  This was the only place in Guatemala where people were neither very friendly nor very helpful.  You might say it was ""service with a grimace.""  The worst incident during our two day stay was when we were presented a bill one morning for a dinner which we had the night before and had paid in full - yet by the next morning the prices seemed to have mysteriously risen (we refused to pay).  There was also a broken towel curtain in our room with the metal sticking out dangerously.  It is a shame because the place has charm and with focused ownership could be very nice.  As a PS: we had a meal at the"
40,"The location is perfect.  We did a tour with the hotel when we arrived around 10 am. and did another daybreak tour.  The swimming pool is fabulous for the quiet, hot afternoons.  We ate nachos and drank beer at the pool.  The food is good so don't worry that this is where you will eat during your stay.  The rooms around the pool look really cool - next time I'll ask to be put there.  The proprietor calls you by name and greets you.  One night was plenty, but it is relaxing if you want to stay longer.  Yes, electricity is limited to certain hours and the wireless is not great.  But it is out in the jungle after all..."
50,It could not be more perfect for a hotel in the middle of the jungle! The staff was great especially Roxy who was nice enough to take us on a late night jungle safari to look for red eyed tree frogs and forest tarantulas! Roxy is the best! Overall the whole experience at the hotel was great!
50,This hotel is located within Tikal Park. It is the middle of the road pricing amoung 3 to choose from. Comfortable cabanas. large and  clean pool. Friendly staff and a decent restaurant too.  Highly recommended.
40,"We stayed two nights at the Tikal Inn hotel with the purpose of going to explore Tikal, this is the perfect setting for an adventure. It is a rustic, but charming hotel (they only have electricity available for a few hours in the am and again in the pm). We had a bungalow right by the pool, which was very nice. Service was good and friendly. Food was good. Sunrise tour was excellent, be prepared to be waken up by howler monkeys and bring a small LED flashlight. We hired the private van to and from the Melchor de Mencos border with Belize, it was expensive but very convenient (driver even stopped at a store for us to buy snacks and drinks). The only negative was that driver did not inform us that we needed to go through Guatemala immigration prior to driving us to the hotel (he"
10,"Actually, calling these people con artists is an undeserved compliment, as there was no artistry involved. They just stole our money in plain sight and basically dared us to do anything about it. Yes, the hotel is in walking distance to the ruins. Yes, it has a pool. And yes, the food is acceptable. All good things. But the manager whom we dealt with lacks all ethics. The story:  We check in. We decide to upgrade to a package that includes a tour, as other Trip Advisor reviewers recommend. The upgrade is advertised in dollars, but naturally we have to pay in local currency, and the manager just makes up an exchange rate out of thin air, way above any exchange rate anywhere else in the country. So he charges us $20 or $30 more than the listed price. I let it slide. We need a tour"
30,"The hotel rooms are clean and comfortable and the location is ideal. The restaurant food is great too. The service is wonderful. Our only disappointment was that they control the power with a generator. There is no AC in the rooms. Not a problem with the fans in the rooms. However, they power off the generator at 10 pm and that means the fan won't work, and you cannot charge or use any devices that require power. (C-PAP users beware).   They turn the power on around 6 or 7 am for about an hour. Then back on around noon for an hour and then again around 5 pm until 10 pm.   I wish they had listed that on their website or at least told us about it at check-in.  For the price they charge, I would have expected that courtesy.   If you don't need electricity for your health and don't"
50,"There are two different hotels - one hostel and the hotel. We stayed at the hotel where the rooms have private bathrooms.   The rooms are great, the look completely new with two beds and a mosquito net on top of each.  The windows are also with nets and for cooling there is a big ventilator in the room. I actually prefer air conditioning but for a night or two it should be fine.   During the night you hear the jungle. Don't be surprised when this is loud.   The bathroom is a bit small, but has a big shower with hot water.   Actually I was surprised about the quality.   The restaurant has decent prices and the food was good. The hotel also have a pool where you can relax with some drinks.   Even the hotel is saying Wifi is available, you can't much more than WhatsApp.   Located"
50,"OUTSTANDING hotel located in Tikal. Anyone planning on visiting Tikal, without question should consider staying an extra night at the Jungle Lodge. Most Tikal Tours run from Flores and can be done in a few hours, but to get a real appreciation for the park, consider staying at least 2 days. You will not be disappointed. Hire a guide (well worth it - and I'm normally not into hiring guide), and experience both a sunrise and sunset on top of one of the Temples. For sunrise, make sure to bring some extra warm clothes (e.g. jacket, towel, light blanket) - since it will get chilly on top of the Temple in the early pre-sunrise morning.  We stayed in a Junior Suite Bungalow with first class amenities. The rooms were modern, spacious and outfitted with high-end furniture, with an"
50,Hotel and staff were wonderful. Food wasn't great but there are other options close by like the Jaguar Inn. The tub stopper in our bath wasn't working. When i brought this to the staff's attention it was fixed in 5 mins. Pool is great and there is a happy hour all day! Would stay again!
40,"(-) Electricity is from 5 a.m. to 8 a.m, from 13 to 14 and from 17 to 22. Very bad wi fi and only in the lobby and restaurant. Toilets are outside of the rooms and it is inconvenient to go during night because there is no light (no electricity), so bring your own flashlight! No AC, only fan. We wanted to go to Uaxactun and were offered a trip from the Lodge (40$ p.p). It was twice expensive compared to the price offered by a guy, who brought us from Flores.  (+) Rooms 8 and 11 are good.  Jungle lodge is very close to the entrance to Tikal National Park - 5 minutes walk."
40,"I'm cycling from Cancun to Palenque  for the end of the world (as we know it?) A tough hilly road from the Guatemala border at Benque to Tikal, through El Remate and the lakeside to the national parque. The jaguar inn was on the other side os a patio tile laying construction site in honour of the King of Spain and the president of Guatemala, who are coming in for the end of the world on the 21st December 2012.  Tripped over a number of construction items. The hotel rooms are clean and good although the hot water and electricity and WiFi are only sometimes. The food is reeasonable.  I preffered the English breakfast with baked beans unusual... Cesar is the star of the place.  he leads people to the sunrise and sunset on top of various monuments.  He is knowledgeable about flora,"
50,"Stayed here in November 2012 and had room 10 which was very clean, hot showers and no bugs. Tomingo (sp?) at the Reception desk and his staff were always very helpful and attentive. We had all meals here as we toured the other two hotels but the atmosphere was much more western at the other two places. The Tikal Inn had a huge flatscreen TV with zombies sitting in front of it. The menu at Jaguar Inn has more local dishes/sauces on offer. We arranged a sunrise tour with Jose (left at 4am) and he was very good at getting us to Temple IV before anyone else. After the sunrise he gave us a tour of all the main temples until about 9am when it was definitely time for breakfast back at the Jaguar Inn. If you are going to stay in the park then stay here! Hammocks outside the rooms are"
50,staff is friendly and helpful.  The room was very clean and saw no bugs.  The shower has wonderful water pressure and was plenty hot.  the restaurant was very fairly priced and good food.  It is right outside the tikal park entrance and the museums.  So convenient.  It always was very safe.
40,"Our stay at Jaguar Inn was pleasant and what we needed for rest in Tikal park.  The room was clean and comfortable.  Nothing fancy, but adequate.  The food in the restaurant was excellent.  We ate there every meal and everything was good.  The guide from there, Caesar, was excellent.  We went with him on the Sunrise Tour of Tikal.  We enjoyed our time."
40,"So, spending the night inside the national park is a must, if you like nature, widlife, sunrises over mystical places, and less tourists. I'm pretty sure Jaguar Inn is the least expensive of the 3 hotels inside the park, and it will due. Their food is actually pretty darn good (dinner only served until 9pm!) and their rooms are comfortable enough, considering you're in the middle of the rain forest. If you can't deal with insects and heat and humidity, sleep in the nearby Flores, but if you want the full experience - stay here. Hot water is only claimed to be avaialbe until 9pm which is when the electricity shuts off, but I took a shower around 9:30 and enjoyed it thouroughly with perfectly hot water. The beds are basic and have musquito nets which are necessary when you're in"

Very kind and courteous customer service...   Very nice clean pool for all guests...  Sunrise and Sunset package available but not the best available tours unfortunately...

The literature cautioned there were be no electricity between certain hours.  I never could figure out when we didn't actually have electricity but it didn't seem to matter!  I had hot water for my shower and got up at 3:30am to do the tour to the top of Temple IV.  Well worth it.  I would love to stay longer and just enjoy the ambiance.   Wifi was ok as long as I was in the lobby!"
50,"Grat staff, small hotel, 100 m from the site entrance. Good food and nice pool to relax.  Came in a motorcycle trip from Cancun, across Belize. Tips : carry Quetzales, plenty, Guatemala is more expensive than anticipated and using USD is harder than we were told. Border crossing. Do the sunrise tour, is really worth it. Roads are in very good shape and are very safe. Very few holes or bumps. People is super friendly and willing to help."
40,"We stayed at the hotel for its proximity to the park, but what made out stay spectacular was the excellent archeological and sunrise tours provided by the hotel. We were lucky enough to have Flaviola as our guide for both tours, and she was incredibly knowledgeable,   articulate (in English), and knew the ins and outs of all parts of the park. In addition to Flavoola, the other staff from the hotel were attentive and pleasant. The rooms were clean and the pool refreshing after a long day at the park.  My only real complaint was the weak wi-fi (but what do you really expect in the park?). It was more expensive than every other hotel on our trip, but the high quality tour and proximity to the park made it worth it.  "
50,"We stayed for one night and had a wonderful time with our kids. In hindsight we should have stayed longer. We found the manager, Alfredo, to be friendly and helpful. The waiters were warm and extremely attentive even when the dining room was crowded. I speak some Spanish and that helped. The staff was patient and gracious with our imperfect Spanish. The four of us found the meals offered in the package to be simple but delicious, made with fresh ingredients and nicely presented. They had vegetarian options. I miss the freshly made to order mango and lime juices (using real fruit, no concentrate) and tasty salsa. We saw them make a banana cake from scratch that was delicious. French fries were made from real potatoes they were patiently slicing. They also offer a menu of other"
50,"Very comfortable stay at jungle lodge.  Our rooms was beautiful, nice mosquito netting. Although, I don't know if we needed it.   The bathroom was updated and clean.  The restaurant was very nice.  Great food and great service. Even though most servers only spoke spanish and my spanish is very weak,  we muddled through.  We went to the temple for sunrise and the restaurant had coffee ready for us at 4:30 in the morning."
40,I think Jungle Lodge is one of the better options for staying in the park. We were in a bungalow and it was clean and reasonably comfortable. Food at the restaurant was fine. Wifi only in main office and very spotty and slow.
50,"We just spent 11 days seeing Guatemala. As Mayan history and culture is my passion the Tikal and its vicinity portion was paramount. Thank goodness we chose 3 nights at this fantastic property. Yes, the rooms are super nice even with limited nighttime electricity. Yes, you are mere steps to the Park entrance allowing a bit of cheating on entry and closing times. Yes, the food is first rate and the staff helpful and pleasant. And yes, you will pay some more for all these advantages. Splurge, you came a long way for a once in a lifetime experience.  You will never regret Tikal or the Jungle Lodge. Promise. "
40,"The Jungle Lodge is only a few steps away from the entrance to the Tikal National Park and the famous Mayan ruins, and is truly a gem in the jungle. It was great to rest in the comfortable beds after hours of walking in the park. The restaurant had excellent food, which was fortunate as there weren't many options. The lights went out at 10:30 PM and came back at 6 AM. We enjoyed the sounds of the jungle all night long, such a unique experience.   The staff was very amiable and made us feel valued as guests. We also booked with them a shuttle out of Tikal to the border. We wish we could have stayed another night."
40,"The location of this hotel is brilliant - almost right beside the Mayan archaeological site of Tikal. You are in the heart of sub-tropical rainforest and sitting on your verandah outside your bungalow you can see quetzals, toucans, monkeys and parrots - and lots more. You can walk in to the archaeological site ( after buying a ticket of course!) and this means you can be there early in the day, before the crowds arrive.   The food is ample but rather bland. There is a nice pool which is a good way to finish off a day's site seeing."
50,"our visit was very nice to be staying in tikal Jaguar Inn, a very comfortable hotel with excellent restaurant. very clean rooms with electricity. find all the facilities we need. the hotel has a shuttle service and guide, the guide's name is Cesar, is excellent. speaks very good English, and takes a tour of the park tikal morning, excellent experience.The hotel is located within the park which allows for a very comfortable trip, to enter and leave the park without any problem.spaghetti are very delicious, and the breakfasts are very complete.The hotel is the only air-conditioned restaurant and has power for most of the day, Internet access and telephone."
40,"real nice place to stay, conveniently next door to the entrance to the ruines, so you can stroll around untill sunset and go in again at sunrise. guide service, good english speaking. good restaurant, friendly staff, wifi and internet availible. good choise."
40,"Not a whole lot of options to stay in Tikal, but this was certainly not bad. They arranged for a sunrise tour for us, and the room was clean. We didn't find bugs to be an issue, but they may depend on time of year, and when your deep in CA bugs are unavoidable regardless."
30,"Stayed in this hotel for 2 nights, with the intention of exploring the Tikal park. I booked a single room with shower, without knowing that the hotel provides bangalos, not proper hotel rooms. I am not a bangalo type of guest and consequently, slept vey badly, coping with heat, humidity and the hundreds of insects in my room. However, it was nice to see and hear the animals who live around the hotel. Try the local specialty, pollo with a special salsa. Pros: location, friendly staff, nice driver, nice tour guide Cesar, hammock, watching animals from front door. Cons: lack of hot water for shower (in theory you can get hot from 6-9 and 18-21, but it was not always like that),  lack of mosquito net, no breakfast included in the price, thin walls meaning you can hear anything from"
50,"Our group of 41 students and mentors visited Tikal following a two-week humanitarian service at Ak'Tenamit School just off the Rio Dulce.  We worked very hard during our stay and so we were looking forward to this much anticipated, end reward.  We couldn't have been more pleased with our stay.  The service was outstanding.  They even helped get us a birthday cake to celebrate a birthday for a member of our group.  The value was excellent and the rooms were clean and quiet.  After our two-week mission, we particularly loved the hot showers, fans and electricity!  The staff bent over backwards to ensure our stay (including food, tours and lodging) was as comfortable as possible.  They did a remarkable job and we would highly recommend Hotel Jaguar Inn for your stay."
40,"The attraction of this hotel is that it is located right in the park.  Tikal is amazing and if you stay inside the park, you can go to the top of a pyramid with a guide and watch the jungle wake up in the morning.  Now, there is a price to pay for this in comfort.  The hotel has electricity for only part of the day.  It will turn off at 10 pm, I believe.  The huts are very comfortable, but you will not have a fan after the power turns off.  The pool is well maintained and quite refreshing.  There isn't much variety on the menu in the hotel's restaurant, but most people only stay one or possibly two nights so a lot of selection really isn't needed.  There is wifi at the front desk area and there is a lounge right there.  The wifi is not capable of doing things like facetime, but"
50,"We stayed for two nights/two days to visit Tikal.  Situated directly in the Tikal National Park.  Airport pickup service is available straight to the resort.  We had both tours:  the sunset and the sunrise----both are well-worth it.  English-speaking guides.  Our cottage was well-maintained and comfortable.  They do ration the electricity---only on for a couple of hours in the morning (6:30 - 9:30 a.m.) and then a couple hours in the evening (lights out at 9;30)....it is in a national park.  They have a generator back up.  The grounds are lush---full of tropical flowers, the sounds of birds, and yes, it is the jungle.  Breakfast and dinner is included in the hotel price. The food was excellent----of course, we were always hungry after hours of physical activity hiking around the"
40,"We stayed here for two nights to visit Tikal. The hotel organised a price on top of the room charge to include breakfast, dinner and a tour of Tikal for us which cost about $25USD. Dinner included starter of soup, then choice of main and cake for dessert. Breakfast was either pancakes, eggs or omelette. There is limited power at the hotel, it only runs between 6-8am in the morning and 6.30 to 9pm at night but there is a battery light in the room so you can still see at night.  Staying at the hotel means you can easily do the sunrise tour. We chose the sunset tour as it was quite cloudy in the morning and it was really beautiful. Also the park is relatively empty then as most of the shuttle leave at 5pm. Also staying here meant we could go to the park early then sit in the pool"
30,"Not much to pick from near the ruins. I stayed here 4 nights in the most basic rooms back in the jungle. Pool was nice. Restaurant was blah, I like the other hotel restaurants better. This place baits you with a low room price but then tries to pull a Walt Disney by constantly overcharging for shuttles, H20, and heavy handed sales pitches for package deals for tours and food. Bed was comfortable as it could be in 100f weather and no AC or fan. limited power during a couple hours in the evening and morning, I think the other hotels offer a longer run time on their generators. WI-Fi barely worked and was much better at the other hotel restaurants. Overall a good stay but got very tired of being overcharged for basics and their constant package sales pitch. Staff was friendly and"
40,"We stayed two nights at Tikal Inn - in one of their 'garden/jungle view' rooms. The inn is charming with beautiful gardens. Our room was large and provided comfortable and quiet sleep. (OK, in the morning you will hear lots of birds & howling monkeys.) Free wifi is available - but it doesn't work very well. Don't expect to be particularly successful with endless surfing. (Then again, this isn't why you are at Tikal.) Bathroom is spacious. It was crazy HOT in April -so we had no need for hot water.  You can have a cold or ""warm"" shower.  One complimentary bottle of water in the room.  We had an all-inclusive deal.  Our room came with breakfast and dinner.  We thought the food was quite good. Breakfast pancakes had lovely syrup. Pasta was quite good at dinner. The service was"
40,"Good, comfortable rooms and very clean bathrooms. Nice pool area where you can get food and drinks. It is the closest hotel to the entrance of the ruins. Only drawback is the restaurant is pricy, and you are pretty much stuck with it as the only place to eat unless you walk to the other hotels but the prices there are not much better."
50,I was very glad i chose Jungle Lodge for my two night stay to see Tikal . It is so close to the site only 5 minuites walk to ticket  sales .It really allows you to be at the site early before othet visitors arrive . The staff are super  helpful  and friendly . Facilities  are excellent  and its a great atmosphere  . The food is first rate and not expensive  I could not have been happier  . They arranged  transport straight  to Belize border  after  my stay and driver  went right  to immigration with me minding  my bag as I completed  my forms . Highly  reccomend 
30,"We stayed here on two separate occasions overnight so as to visit the Tikal ruins, and on return from the Cayo district, Belize. It is of course, in the jungle and while the rooms are adequately provisioned(all appear to be individual chalets), the electricity is by generator only and is on only for a few hours evening and mid-morning. They told us there was an emergency supply to operate one light and the ceiling fan, the latter you definitely need as the humidity is 100%.So we went to sleep with the fan on and at some point the electricity stopped  and the back-up kicked in. We were awoken by a noise like a tractor in the room. This was the fan- so choice between sweating profusely or putting up with noise- either way no sleep! There is no glass in the windows only screens, so"
30,We spent one night at this very basic hotel - the electricity is only on during certain hours - 7:00 am to 10:00 am and then again about 5:00 pm until 9:30 pm.  There is no hot water during the times it is off.  It was cool enough - high 60s - while we were there and there was no need for air condition or a ceiling fan.  The bed was comfortable enough.  The bar serves good drinks and the food was adequate - breakfast was better than dinner.  The main calling card is that it is in the national park and within walking distance of the ruins.
50,"Lovely large room, though it was referred to as junior room. Like new. Just walking the grounds is like a garden walk. Delightful staff. A few notes about Tikal planning; we had done little. Plan to be unplugged. We had no cell service. Electricity is only on 8 hrs, except 24 hrs for fan and one outlet we used to charge phones. Common area WiFi is very spotty and slower than dial-up. Hey! You are IN the jungle. We woke up daily to howler monkeys! Amazing! The hotel will take credit cards and you can charge food, drinks, tour guides, and shuttle to your room. Easy. However there is no ATM except in Flores (an hour away) and ALL park fees, museum admission and tips for hotel staff require cash (Quetzales). The Jungle Lodge airport shuttle (call to arrange for it ahead of time)"
50,"Spent two nights while touring the Archeological site. We had a cottage facing the pool which was convenient as they were having an unusual heat event. The cottage itself, was clean and well maintained with a nice hot shower. The area around the pool seemed to have more of a breeze. ""The deal"" with the the Sunrise tour, breakfast, and dinner turned out to be truly a good deal. The Sunrise tour with our guide ""Elias"" was very good, recognizing that every guide is different. He seemed to have a formal education as background and was very passionate in dispelling fallacious assumptions from more fact based theories. The food in the restaurant was good and reasonably priced. The staff were all friendly though the manager had difficulty with English."
30,"You don't come to stay at Tikal for comfort; it's all about the location. My wife and I booked a ""Junior Suite"" (sight unseen), which consisted of two beds and a single nightstand. Apparently the extra floor space in the room qualified it as a ""suite."" The bathroom was comfortably sized. We ate at the restaurant twice, and it was OK. Excellent service in the restaurant & at the front desk.  Note there is no air conditioning and power is turned on only twice a day -- for approx. 2 hours in the morning and again in the evening. In hot weather this can make for a long and sticky night. But this is the same for all lodging options here. It's a small price to experience Tikal at sunset and first thing in the morning when there are few people at the site."
40,Hotel Tikal Inn is a simple and slightly run down but charming lodge right next to the historic site. The rooms are basic but clean and functional. Electricity runs only for a few hours per day (but Wifi reportedly for all of the day - we didn't test this). Food is old style but good. The pool was great and kids as well as parents had a blast. Spider monkeys paid a visit to the hotel garden which was the highlight for our two year old.
50,"Bungalow room was clean, comfortable beds and pillows.  Inn itself was fantastic, food very good, service superior, felt welcomed and cared for. Magnificent surroundings, in the jungle.  Pool spotlessly clean, large, refreshing"". Would return if I ever can.  Management seemed to really care."
40,"I stayed in Tikal Inn during my trip Mexico-Belize-Guatemala.  Booking - nothing special, just ordinary booking.com routine and I got budget (cheapest one) twin/double room for 62 EUR (incl taxes) for 1 night. I think it's not a place where you stay for a longer period as it is situated within the Tikal Park area where guests spend mostly 1 day. So the booking was smooth as well check in procedure. And budget room for us meant that our building was little bit away from the main building. It was couple of minutes walk along the jungle road :) (see my pic). Actually it was nice walk in the dark after dinner. As the pathway is lighted you don't have to be afraid.  Location - as I already mentioned Tikal Inn is within the Tikal National Park area and it's walking distance to park"
40,"Every staff member I met - from the driver, to the servers, to the manager who I exchanged emails prior to my arrival to the tour guide - were all great, friendly and lovely people. They all helped made my stay in Tikal memorable.  The location is great because it's just outside the park gates.  But because it's technically in the jungle, there are some things that have to be just accepted as part of the environment.  My room was nice enough with a patio and a hammock.  I had a fan and I really had no problem with hot water.  (Although they do have electricity restrictions because they are in the jungle - ie, they switch over to a generator during a certain time period.). My problem was that while the room was clean, there were bugs, especially at night.  But once I've accepted"
50,"Nice grassy area to pitch your tent. Cold shower, but in this heat, who cares. Clean bathrooms and a restaurant where you can use the internet. Nice place if you just want to pitch a tent and get in to see the ruins early.   Beware that tour bus groups come to have breakfast at 6am, so there is no hope of sleeping in if you are in a tent."
50,"Probably the best place to stay if you want to experience the wisdom of the ancestral knowledge of Tikal's jungle and sacred Mayan ruins. It's only a minute away from the entrance of the Tikal National Park. The food is really good and the rooms are adorable, some even have hammocks.   Electricity does not work after 9 pm, neither is there hot water. So schedule your day accordingly. If you come 'home' late, it would be a better idea not to pay for Wi-Fi password, as it would be useless between 9pm and 7am.   Pay great attention to the sounds of the jungle. Birds, bugs, monkeys... You will hear a lot of different animals chanting day and night. Monkeys might scream during the night, so do not be scared. They do not come to your door.  It is a very beautiful place to stay, and we"
40,"We stayed at the Hotel Jaguar Inn at Tikal for two nights.  The room was very pleasant and clean, however the food at the hotel restaurant was not great.  Eat next door at the Hotel Tikal Inn, the food is amazing.  There is also a lovely pool next door.  Although the Hotel Jaguar Inn was fine, next time I would spend a few extra bucks and stay at the much nicer, Hotel Tikal Inn."
30,"We stayed for one night in November 2010. It was $64 for a double room, which they can only get away with because you have to spend the night to see the sunrise and there are only two other hotels in the park. It was fairly basic but we got a good's night rest and were able to enjoy both the sunset and sunrise on Pyramid IV. Amazing experiences you must do in your lifetime! The staff were nice to us at reception and in the restaurant. Yes, there are some bugs in the room, you can't drink the water, and it can be noisy, but you're in the jungle after all. As in most place we've experienced in Latin America, the pace is slower and some Spanglish, patience and a smile go a long way.  The dinner (60 quetzal mains, 20 quetzal drinks) and boxed breakfast (45 quetzals) were overpriced"
40,"We stayed here one night during our visit to Tikal.  It was a perfect location, directly outside the entrance to the park.  We visited the park for several hours, then relaxed by the pool.  Dinner was very good, and the accommodations were very comfortable. The hotel only had electricity from 5 to 10pm.  We took the sunrise tour which began at a wake up knock on the door at 3:45.  Our guide from the hotel was knowledgeable and personable.  We had a magical time at sunrise.  "
40,"The rooms are quite basic but beds were comfy. The food is quite expensive for what it is, but there are a couple of other options around. The pool is a nice touch, nice to laze around and listen to the jungle. We stayed here because we wanted to do a sunrise tour of the ruins, which was a lot of fun. Keep an eye out for tarantulas!  It was more expensive than most other places we've stayed at but I guess you're paying for the location over anything else."
50,"An excellent location to give you lots of time to explore the ruins and temples. The accommodation is good, decent rooms and a hot shower. A nice pool area to relax in the heat of the afternoon, and we even had our lunch served there which was great. It was great to be able to explore the park outside of rush hours, and to take our time and wander back when we wanted to without being constrained by transport requirements. We found the staff very helpful. A very relaxing place to stay, would definitely recommend."
50,"This place puts you exactly where you want to be, at the entrance to Tikal. The staff was great and the lodge itself was fantastic. The rooms are stylish and the pool area is well done. The wildlife is what makes it special, Spider and Howler Monkeys every morning. We never ate there as its quite pricey but we discovered all the food around there is expensive. Jaguar lodge had good food as did the comedor.  Worth the price, would definitely come back and recommend the Jungle Lodge."
50,"On a study abroad trip and stayed here for two nights. Their driver George was absolutely fantastic with our group. Although accommodating 25 people in restaurant is not easy they did an absolutely fantastic job with our group. The food is well prepared and there are plenty of options. The milkshake was delicious.  They were well organized and did great. The rooms were absolutely amazing and the beds were comfortable. Although the shower was not hot it was not freezing. It's a great location to walk right into the park, and experience the wildlife right in front of you.  "
30,"Really pleasantly surprised by the food, great quality and delicious.   Morning sunrise tour of Tikal good, worth doing being so close. Cool to see the jungle appearing out of the mist and hearing the jungle creatures wake up. The guided tour straight after was good but doesn't cover very much after the initial background overview, guide gave selected pieces of info. I felt we missed a lot of interesting facts by not having a full tour later in the day. Can get facts from the info boards as you walk round but I would get another tour guide after breakfast if doing it again.   Hotel is in a lovely setting with the huts around the pool. Didn't use the pool unfortunately as only a quick stay but would have been a godsend on a humid day. The main part of the huts are nice -simple"
40,"The Tikal Inn shuttle met us at 7am at the Tica bus terminal in Santa Elena for our 2-day stay and the shuttle dropped us in Flores, all arranged by Alfredo at reception. Our room facing the garden had a double bed and a single bed - with firm but comfortable mattress!  Ceiling fan was good when there was electricity - which btw went off usually at 10pm and came on at 6am.  There was a battery powered light for use when there was no power. The louvred windows had netting to prevent insects getting in and we kept these open for ventilation. Bathroom had a shower with hot water, and both the room and bathroom were clean and airy. The food in the restaurant was well prepared and presented by friendly and helpful staff. The sunset and sunrise tours were informative, and both guides"
30,Loved the location in the jungle within walking distance of Tikal Mayan site. The room was very basic but clean and long walk from the reception which was difficult with bags as the path was tough.  No TV. Shower only bathroom. Hot showers. Electricity for limited hours snd was switched off around 10pm and seemed to be in from 6am to 8am when we were there.  Food was awful.  Dawn walk to temple IV was worth doing although our dawn was misty. Good guide who explained a bit about the history etc.  Nice swimming pool and lots of wildlife in the grounds.
40,"Positives: • Great location (easy walk to park entrance) • Large room (even with two double beds). it's actually a self-contained bungalow. • Screens on all sides for air flow • Clean • Pool • Restaurant on site has food options for vegetarians (vs others places in town very limited) • Friendly restaurant staff • Wi-fi in lobby  Negatives: • Shuttles don't seem to be that well timed with arriving and departing flights, so in some cases you may need to use an expensive private shuttle/taxi. • Special deal decision immediately upon arrival. Not s bad deal but a little annoying to be a little pressured into that after a long day of travel. (BTW everyone we watched go through this took the deal, as did we, and we didn't regret it. Keep in mind you can sub-out different meals and/or"
40,"There are only 3 lodges in the jungle at the inside gates of Tikal National Park - this one, Jaguar Inn  & Jungle lodge. It makes sense to stay in these as that's the only way you can make the sunrise from Temple IV. The other option is camping near the entrance gate.  Since it is in the jungle, it's a bit pricey by Guatemalan standards. But with breakfast and dinner included, it kind of makes up for it. The wifi was quite moody, they have a strict lights off policy after 9pm but great pool and lots of wildlife around - birds and monkeys and insects and a big snake (python?) that lives in the roof of the large dining area ! I believe she is called Gertrude : ).  We stayed in one of the bungalows overlooking the pool. Liked it.  Recommended !"
40,"If you want easy access to Tikal and to get into the park before large groups of tourists arrive, stay here. My husband and I stayed here for two nights and absolutely loved the fact that we could wake up at 6 am, walk into the park to explore the ruins, go back to the hotel for a swim while all of tourists from Flores were there, and then return in the late afternoon once everyone else had returned to Flores. If you really want to explore the whole park and see the more remote temples, it's totally worth it.  The rooms were very spacious, clean, and comfortable - they had clearly been updated recently. We had a massive bed with a mosquito net that made the whole experience feel magical. Lights go out at 10 pm, but we were asleep by 9 pm anyways, so it didn't bother us (just"
20,"Let me start by saying the location close to Tikal is great. 2 min walk and you are in the park. Rooms are big, clean and comfortable with clean bathroom and good shower. Food at restaurant was fine. Not many choices and certainly more expensive than anywhere else in Guatemala. The rest leaves a lot to be desired. Now I know we are in the Jungle but if you are an expensive hotel ( for CA standards) and mention wifi you need to provide some reliable wifi, especially if the staff have no ability to answer questions so you are essentially left in the dark. The parts that annoyed us the most were the following : We did the sunrise tour it cost us $45 USD per person. Caesar the guide was terrible. We learnt very little about Tikal or Mayan culture/history. The second part of the tour"
30,"Great location just outside entrance to the pricey national park.  Other, nearby options didn't look as nice.  Rooms are comfy with adequate bathrooms/showers (options include private and shared).  Food was okay."
40,"You can't have a better placement if you want to see Tikal and the sunrise tour, as this hotel is just at the entrance of the walkable area.  We got a very nice and comfortable suite decorated with the style of Hollywood films. Beyond the bathroom there was one additional shower in the open were you can feel in the middle of the jungle. There is also one small terrace with armchairs facing the jungle.  Service was attentive and the price according with the place."
50,"The jungle lodge is a modern, clean and comfortable hotel with great attentive staff and a very good cook!  The rooms are very comfortable and spacious and the fact that it is within the historic Tikal ruins only adds to its mystique.   We were well looked after by Ivana, Eduardo and Don Julio in the restaurant. Food and drinks were excellent no very well priced. Good value and good quality all round.   The hotel has a pool and is well laid out and easily accessible. I find that the Central American countries are more professional hosts and more akin to the service in the USA. I also think they are kind and sincere. Lastly we have felt very safe in both Belize and Guatemala and would recommend this location to families as well as individuals. Well done jungle lodge!"
20,"I stayed for one night, April 4th with my 11 and 13 year olds in a triple room.  First the positives: You are in the park and close to the entrance.  The room was only $90.  That about ends the positives.  I told my kids that the room made a Motel 6 room look extravagant.  I felt like i was in Eastern Europe before the Iron Curtain came down.  Filthy room with big dust balls and spiderwebs on the furniture, bedding was ancient and coarse. Felt like it had not been washed in years.  The curtains were thick and again appeared dusty. Mildew in the shower.  We took showers with our flip flops on.  AND IT WAS HOT.   100 degrees in the shade. I slept about 3 hours since the room was above 80 until around 3 am and the fan did not circlulate enough air to make much difference.  We had a"
40,"The accommodation for $50 a night was excellent. Modern, clean, stylish bathroom, hot water any time. Very comfortable.  The annoying thing is the little survey they hand you in the restaurant. There is no check box for ""speed of service"" :-) The food is good (not great), the staff are friendly, but the service is SO SLOW....    I would definitely recommend the hotel, but you might want to eat somewhere else!"
40,"For the price and location I was very impressed. It's not a 5 star property and is a bit rough around the edges but for the price, I found my room to be clean and well-appointed. I did not experience slow service in the restaurant at all during my 3 nights there, even when the place filled up with day trippers at lunch time. The servers were friendly and attentive.   It's unfortunate that the park now charges everyone who passes through the main gate which is 17km before the hotel at any time. If you arrive late in the afternoon you may have to pay for an admission you may not be able to use. I argued when they wanted to charge me at 8pm and they relented and said I could pay at the entrance fee at the ruins the next day.  The howler monkeys start up at about 2am and don't stop"
40,"I have stayed at the Jaguar Inn many times as it is the least expensive of the three hotels at Tikal.  Most recently, I was there in March 2012 leading a group of 20 university students.  The hotel is charmingly rustic and clean.  Wildlife is abundant and you may see monkeys, parrots, coatamundis, and others.  You may get some insects in your room but you are, after all, in the middle of the jungle.  The hotel staff is friendly and helpful and responds promptly to emails.  Just be sure to give yourself plenty of time at the restaurant.  Like much of Latin America, the pace is much slower and the cultural norm is to not often pester diners.  If you want something, including the check, you will need to signal the staff."
30,"We stayed at the Jaguar Inn again at the end of February. I have stayed here many times and always had a great experience. The bungalow was just fine.  The problem with this visit  is that the restaurant meal service was painfully slow! After a unremarkable dinner after 2 hours, we opted to head down the road to eat at the comedor across from the Visitor's center the next day. Fantastic chicken, and service was great. I'll be back again in November and see if the service returns to past levels at the Jaguar."
40,"We flew in on the early flight from Guate. and were met by the hotel shuttle, taken the 45 minute drive to the hotel and were on the trails with a guide by 9am for a four hour tour, included in package.    We had a room in the white building overlooking the garden and it was quite spacious with three beds, large bathroom and ceiling fan.  We were there Feb. 23/24 and were surprised at how windy it was and the comfortable temps.  Based on other reviews, we thought it was going to be miserably hot and humid - maybe we just lucked out!  Sleeping at night with the louvers open on the window and listening to the night sounds of the jungle was pure bliss.  Next AM we met in the lobby at 4am for the sunrise tour - highly recommended.  It's magical to sit on the steps of the temple"
40,"We spent two nights at Hotel Tikal Inn in order to experience both sunrise and sunset in the park. It was one of the most memorable parts of our trip to Belize and Guatemala.   The ability to enter the park before the sunrises and the hoards of visitors arrive is an unforgettable experience.   I strongly recommend doing a sunrise tour, returning to the hotel for breakfast, a nap and a lazy lunch by the pool then returning to the park in the late afternoon as all the buses are leaving in order to enjoy sunset.   We stayed in one of the huts facing towards the garden and campground. The room was spacious, clean and well appointed. The pool was by far the highlight of the hotel, especially with all the wildlife that comes to visit (and try to steal your food!). The food at the"
20,"The hotel is located on the grounds of the national park, so location is unbeatable.  You should, however, know what you are getting into.  We booked well ahead, a standard room, and when we checked in, were led out of the hotel, past the next building, and on through the jungle, on a narrow, unlighted path, to another building that felt a good quarter mile away, that had 3 or 4 rooms. We looked inside at the two narrow single beds, thought about being that far from the hotel, and turned around and went back.  Yes, we could have a room in the hotel building for another $35.  Better, but even in that building, electricity is only on from 6:30-8 AM and again in the evening, 6:30 to 9 PM.  Means you sleep without ceiling fans, and if you miss those few hours, cannot have a shower. "
30,"The main feature of the Tikal Inn is its position within the park. This meant that we could spend both the sunrise and the sunset at the ruins. Rooms were basic but very pleasant. Despite an e-mail asking for a bungalow looking out to the forest we were given one facing the swimming pool which we found very noisy. However, we managed to change after the first night and it was much quiter as well as having a more interesting outlook for someone interested in wildlife. Our package came with vouchers for brakfast and dinner but not lunch. The food was pretty dire though the service was good. On the last day we ordered lunch outside the voucher system and discovered that there was a much wider menu and the food was much better. The guides arranged by the hotel for the sunrise tour,"
40,"We loved Tikal and having the opportunity to have a base inside the park was amazing, if only to see sunset from the top of the awe-inspiring ruins (tip: I found sunset was brilliant from Temple II). There are 3 accommodation options, Tikal Inn being the cheapest (by a small margin). Rooms were big, basic, comfortable and clean. The bathroom was a little on the small side and the shower far from luxurious, but it's in the jungle, so you take what you can get! It was great to have the option of a pool, as it does get hot there. Be prepared for the electricity supply to cut out during the day and late at night. However, there is a battery powered light and 24 hour electricity supplied in the lobby. To be honest, if you are in your room long enough to notice, you are not making the"
30,"The Jaguar Inn exterior is quite nice. A beautiful restaurant, great looking grounds, and the bungalows look nice. But inside the bungalow (we had Bung. 10) was a different story. The sheets felt dirty, the towels were worn and theadbare, and the walls had grime and fingerprints everywhere, and the ceiling fan wobbled and squeaked non-stop. The room just felt grungy.  If the service was great, then I probably wouldn't mind so much, but instead when we arrived the hotel reception booth was closed (I never did see it open), and went into the restaurant to check in, where we received blank stares and mild confusion. At the restaurant it took forever to get a menu, and it felt mostly like we were being a pain by just being there. The food was ok, but overpriced.  Those things I"
40,I lived the rustic feel of the Jaguar Inn.  Being right inside the Tikal National Park made it so nice to experience this incredible archeological site.    The whole staff was excellent.    We especially appreciated all of the little things Rony Corvada did to make us feel at home.  I would stay there again; without hesitation.
50,"We spent four nights at Jaguar Inn and had a very enjoyable time.  Freddie at the Front Desk and Alfredo among several others gave us five star service.  The rooms were clean, food was fine and the service and friendliness were wonderful.  The shower water could be hotter but that was minor--my companion had no problem with that!  I highly recommend it and I would definitely go again if I have the chance.  It is a low key, friendly and very comfortable place to stay while adventuring in the incredible jungle."
40,"I choose this hotel with *extreme* trepidation after reading the other reviews here. But I wanted to be close to Tikal and it turned out to be the right decision. The complaints of mould and mildew everywhere turned out to be unfounded, though the bed sheets were NOT the cleanest I've ever seen in my life.   Also the lack of ANYWHERE to hang very wet clothes to dry was a real problem.  But there was electricity all through the night, the signs to the contrary notwithstanding, and hot water every morning apart from when it didn't get turned on the first morning.  The staff were helpful and would though turn it on in the evening on request during diner so a much needed shower before bed was possible too."
40,"I spent one night at Jaguar Inn with my friend and we loved it. I actually didn't sleep much during the night because we stayed out very late the night before we were to get up for the sunrise tour of the ruins, but the rest I got during the day (after the tour) was great - very peaceful and exotic. The atmosphere was extremely friendly and it was extremely close to the meeting area for group tours of the ruins. I especially liked the outdoor hammocks we had on our front porch. The bathroom in our room was also a plus. Stay here if you only need a place to secure your things and end up spending most of your time being adventurous. It's not luxurious so don't expect much, but I would go back."
40,Great location and an abundance of wildlife in and around the grounds. The rooms were basic and electricity was only turned on for a short period in the morning and evening. The food was average but the staff was great!
40,"You basically pay for the location.  The rooms are very basic and the food at the restaurant is average. However, staff is very friendly and the pool is clean and a nice way to relax when arriving at the park or after a day walking around. By staying one night you can see sunset at the temples and also do the sunrise tour with the guide, provided by the hotel."
30,"Good location inside the park with nice grounds and walking distance to the ruins. The bungalow was very basic but comfortable and clean.  Staff is pleasant and helpful.  Food is a bit bland, with a limited menu that doesn't change.  Shuttles were on time and drivers were helpful. We booked several walking tours through the hotel which were very informative and well worth the time and cost.   There was only one electrical outlet in the bungalow and power is off during much of the time (by design), so you need to plan you power needs wisely (chargers, etc).  Overall a positive experience which I would do again."
40,"Excellent place to stay when visiting Tikal. We participated in the sunrise tour provided by the hotel and highly recommend this experience. The Inn itself is lovely considering it is in the middle of the jungle. We had hot water for showering and the breeze at night was cool enough without fans or A/C.The food was OK and i would agree with previous reviewers that the staff could be friendlier, but overall it was worth staying here to be that near to Tikal and enter the park at 4am."
40,"me and my sister stayed at the tikal inn for 3 days and 2 nights. it was amazing. I cant say enough about the staff. everyone was good to us. I am handicap and cannot walk for long distances. so the staff arranged me a trip to the ruins around 3 in the afternoon. they drove me to the ruins and we got out and walked around till we was ready to go to the next. we got to visit almost all of it...it was so amazing...beautiful. I am so sorry I cannot remember the guides name. he was a young man that worked for roxy. he very knowledgeable and a pleasure to be around. roxy spoke very good english. and helped us alot. she has been a guide for many years at this sight. and has  also been  a  arqueologist  for 33 years. so if you interested by the mayan culture, find roxy....we seen 3"
20," Wondering where others have stayed in the past, who left glowing reviews for this place.   I'm giving them 2 stars because the location is great and our room is fairly decent considering it's in the middle of nowhere.  The food is borderline disgusting in terms of taste and is definitely disgustingly overpriced. A 'fettuccini with white sauce' is pretty much cooked pasta thrown into soup. Cmon, you're supposed to reduce that stuff on the stove. Did I order a soup noodle? I get that we're in the jungle but these guys are pretty much thieves with how much they're charging for food, if you could even call it that.  Service is a joke. What service? Nobody seems to know how to smile here and could care less about their guests. Restaurant staff seem eager to have you leave (kept"
50,"We loved the Jungle Lodge Hotel!  It was so pretty and very clean and right at the gate to Tikal so no driving.  The swimming pool area and beautiful cushioned lounge patio bed's around the swimming pool were so comfy and welcoming after hiking all day in Tikal, climbing pyramids and much walking.  A splash in the pool and lounge was an excellent way to end the day.  The restaurant and staff were very friendly and helpful and speak english also.  The food was very good too.  We initially stayed in a town about 45 minutes outside of the Tikal Park but found that it was a long drive to get to Tikal in the morning and so we moved to the jungle lodge so that we could just wake up and eat some breakfast which opens at 6 am and then walk down a path to the gate to Tikal.  Very"
30,"Stayed here for one night to visit Tikal. The room was comfortable (think standard 3 star hotel room) and good given you're in the jungle. There's no electricity after 10pm but most people will be staying here to be able to get up early to visit Tikal, so that doesn't really matter. It's expensive for Guatemala but you're paying for the location, right by the site. However some issues: we ate dinner in the hotel and this was quite expensive and not particularly good (my pork loin was small and tough); we ordered a 'box breakfast' to take with us to Tikal in the morning but there was nobody there to give it to us as had been planned; and when our shuttle back to Flores failed to turn up, they wouldn't call the company for us and charged us US$1 per minute to use the phone."
50,"We were in a junior suite, which wasn't very expensive, but was very comfortable.  The pool was great.  Food was good.  The main lodge was also great, reminiscent of the US national park lodges.  We didn't check out the other two hotels, but I have to think that this is the hotel of choice in Tikal."
40,"We stayed in this lodge within the Tikal park and really enjoyed our stay.  We arrived later in the day and were able to explore the park for a few hours before dark.  We really enjoyed their pool, so refreshing after the hot hike in the park!  We did not had dinner but snacked and had a few drinks at the bar, the 2 staff working in the restaurant and bar were very friendly and we practiced our Spanish with them, they were very patient! rooms were very clean and seemed to be recently updated.  The beds were comfortable, one needed to use the mosquito net because, you're in a jungle park after all!  I think the price we paid was reasonable for everything that we got and we thought the service was overall very good.  Tikal is an amazingly spectacular place and that's what you're"
30,"We spent 2 nights at Jaguar Inn. We appreciated having electricity and the beds were comfortable. After reading reviews we expected poor restaurant service. It was slow, but not horrible. The breakfasts were good, but the dinner was average. We ate at the little restaurants near the entrance to the park and LOVED them! The location in the park was perfect. We took a 2 hour lunch break to relax."
30,"After reading the recent reviews, I guess we were lucky.  I had asked for quiet rooms (2 rooms) upfront so the rooms were fine.  They were expensive for what you got, but that's what you get for having a room in the Park. We paid $75 for a double and $50 for a single. I wanted electricity all night so I chose this hotel.  We ran the ceiling fan all night. We thought the food was fine and the service was a little slow, but it's Guatemala, not the USA.The guys at the Desk were fine.  In fact, I received an e-mail from them as a reminder of the deposit that was needed."
20,"We stayed in what the manager assured us were the best rooms in the hotel - 2 double beds in a room + bunk bed, en-suite, AC, second floor with a beautiful garden view. The hotel runs  its own generator so we had power at all times.  But everything else ... They know we'll come. Even if sheets are dirty, even if there is mold in the bathroom and pillows smell something strange - as a dog slept on it, we'll still come Even if food is bland and way overpriced, even if waiting staff is uninterested and slow, and still expects us to give tips (which we do), no matter what, we'll come. Because we come not to stay in Jaguar Inn but to see magnificent Tikal. So they do not bother to correct all these problems - we pay anyway, and we pay handsomely by Guatemalan standards.  I have to"
30,"I agree with the other recent reviews, the room was clean, and location was great and the hotel grounds lovely BUT the staff need to be replaced! Expect to wait at least 1 hour if your order food, regardless if you are the only one in the restaurant. The food tasted good, but there is zero reason it should take that long. My bill was also incorrect twice, be sure to careful to inspect your check. The man behind the desk also grossly inflated prices to us and when we pushed back, he rolled his eyes and said there was nothing he could do. Example, a  sunrise tour through the hotel, $60 US. Walk outside, $12 US. I also felt as a female, the guy behind the desk was less respectful than he was when talking to male visitors."
20,"First, the good: the rooms were great and fairly good value, while the location inside the park is excellent. We could have really enjoyed staying here, however:  The service was terrible. Really poor. We waited 55 minutes from ordering breakfast to it arriving, when there was only one other occupied table in the restaurant. It simply shouldn't take that long to prepare a few eggs. This type of thing happened several times, with the waiter even collecting menus, but then going to other tables to lay place mats before bringing them to us. This was just bizarre. The sleep quality was also awful because of the noise: firstly, the walls of the bungalows are very thing. Secondly, there were extremely noisy guests walking around late at night who kept us awake. Normally I would not"
40,"We stopped in here to stay the night while touring Tikal.  The scenery is beautiful and the grounds are kept very nice.  This is more of a Eco-Friendly place to stay, rooms were very clean.  The howler monkeys were just what we needed to fall asleep!"
50,"This is a perfect place to stay while visiting Tikal National Park.  We flew into Flores and were met at the airport by the driver arranged by the Hotel Tikal Inn. We arrived at the inn in time for a very pleasant dinner, followed by an early bed time--and an equally early wake up the next morning.  When you visit Tikal you are basically off the grid, so don't expect a 5 star city hotel.  This is a very clean and pleasant inn, and we thought it was a fine value. The meals were good, and the staff was very courteous and responsive to our needs for the two nights we were there.  When we left, the driver was ready and waiting at the correct time, and since it was before breakfast time in the inn, someone in the kitchen made us sandwiches to take with us.  (It had not occurred to us"
50,"Stayed here during an overnight from San Ignacio to see Tikal. We arranged the reservation through booking.com, which seemed pretty painless. We got the normal room, which was clean and quiet enough. To be honest, the hotel related traffic was not ""noisy"",but the howler monkeys nearby did wake us up at 2 am (which was neat). We had  breakfast and dinner through our tour package, which turned out to be pretty good. Wifi was slow, and power cycling can curb a spontaneous hot shower, but the trade off is worth it. We saw monkeys, turkeys, and some large pseudo Guinea pigs on the grounds while we were having cocktails and playing cards.   Very convenient for park touring, and we would stay there again. "
40,"We stayed only one night at the Tikal Inn in December 2014. The hotel is located inside the park which was convenient for us as we had limited time to see all of the ruins. First, I'm going to touch a bit on transportation. We took a taxi from San Ignacio to the Guatemala border, it was cheap $5BZ/car (we were told to always take Taxis that have PVO on their license plates, better rates. If you need more information go to Pacz Tours in San Ignacio, the English man working there was very helpful), we had no problem crossing the border. There are men at the border on each side, with whom you can exchange money, you will need quetzals as there are no bank machines once you are in the park and they do not except BZD or USD. It got interesting once we crossed the border, all of the"
40,"The hotel was clean, the pool was a great spot to relax, and the food was decent. We bought breakfast and dinner, and got a sunrise tour included, which was great! The beds were comfy, hot water showers, slow wi-fi, free coffee for the morning tour. It was a little pricey for what we got, but was definitely worth it to stay within the park!"
50,"Our entire family (6 people) stayed here for 2 nights )Nov 19 and 20, 2016). We had one suite and 2 junior suites. The suite was spacious and had a nice& comfortable bed. Indoor and outdoor showers. Nice garden in the back. Very clean and quiet. Although the electricity is cut off after 11pm, our room had the electricity. It really helps. The suite number is 5 and close to the lobby. There was Internet connection in the room. The hotel is in walking distance to the TIkal National park. The hotel personnel was very friendly and professional and warm. We also loved the swimming pool. They arranged the guide for the park. The guide had very good knowledge and spoke very good English. The hotel also arranged our pickup from Flores airport. It takes 1 hour from Flores airport to the"
20,"The only reason to stay in this hotel is to do the early morning jungle walk - the hotel is very overpriced, the food is not good at all, and the staff definitely know that they don't need to impress you once you're there. Also, the fact that the electricity shuts off frequently is annoying, and we had a problem with hot water. Not what you expect for the price. Stay in a hotel in El Remate - its about a 30 min drive to the lodge, but you can always get a taxi (or take a shuttle, although they seem infrequent) and you'll get SO much more for your money."
50,"Overall, we were thrilled with our choice on this one. We couldn't have picked a better hotel from which to adventure into Tikal.  The rooms are simple and elegant. We got a suite with a sitting room and bedroom. We used the sofa bed for our twins, which worked well. The room is comfortable and plenty spacious. It featured a very comfy (soft) bed, a beautiful bath and shower, an outdoor shower, and a private hot tub.   The grounds were well-groomed as well. We made good use of the pool, which was small but fairly quiet. They serve food at the pool, which was a nice way to lounge in the afternoon and get a late snack-lunch.   The lodge sports a restaurant with dine-in or room service. The food was good though not remarkable. We found the service was fantastic for us, and they"
40,"My friend and I stayed here for 1 night in early-Nov. The room we were in was very quaint, but clean and the beds were comfortable. The toilets are clean and well taken care of, the showers are alright, clean but not excessive water pressure. They can only switch on electricity between 6-8am and i think 6-10pm, due to being in a National Park. There is always warm water though.  The staff is very friendly and helpful. The internet is slow, but then again, to be expected, as we are in the middle of nowhere. The pool is quite spacious and has a bar, but it wasn't open when we were there.  The service in the restaurant is amazing, but the food is average. They do give you a free starter and dessert though, which is a nice gesture. The food is overpriced for what it is, but then"
40,"My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our visit to Tikal. The accommodations were clean and spacious with a large bathroom containing both a shower stall and stand alone bathtub. Mosquito nets were positioned over the beds and all windows were well screened.   The dining room, where all meals were served, was clean and well run. The food was average but good and the staff were most accommodating.   The park itself was vibrant, well kept and alive with history.   The only complaint I have concerns the personal hygiene of our tour guide, Hector. I do not doubt that he worked diligently on obtaining his odor for at least a couple of weeks prior to our arrival . I was very busy trying to avoid being too near or even down wind from him and was therefore unable to hear anything he had"
20,"While some of my ratings don't apply because we are camping, the majority of the time around Jaguar was tainted by horrible service.   Currently on month 2 of travels through central America and the Jaguar rates #1 in bad service. Both the front desk and restaurant.   Everything from lack of prompt service, long wait times on food, wrong or missed items on order, no toilet paper in washrooms over two days, laboured responses to simple questions, and general lack of care for service.   Gratitude added to bill, menu says optional. I suggest you decide if it was warranted. "
30,"We stayed here after walking across the border (with Belize) and then catching a collectivo and a bus to Tikal.  We are not unaccustomed basic travel and did not have overly high expectations of this facility.  We would have been more satisfied with its value had we paid the $10 per person fee charged to use on of their mattress in a tent.  As it was, we paid what would be an average rate in a North American small city for a basic room which is about double the rate one would pay in most of Guatemala for the same thing.  What we got was a room that had 24 hour power, 4 hours of hot water, working AC and two fairly good beds with clean linen.  What we didn't get was a room that had been thoroughly cleaned and one that had obvious, long term issues with mildew.  No, there were not"
30,"I have stayed at both the Hotel Tikal Inn and the Jaguar in separate years. I like both places I think they are both about the same as far as the quality of rooms went. I will say this though, the restaurant at Jaguar was the biggest problem on our trip, the food was good but it took forever, service was very poor. What I really loved more than anything though was having power at night and being able to run a fan. If you have never been to Tikal you don't realize how miserably hot and humid it can be and how much a fan means."
50,"I just returned from Guatemala and have only good things to say about the Jaguar Inn. The staff--especially Freddie--was extremely courteous and helpful. I was very happy with my bungalow accommodation--no mosquitoes, no insects. Of the three hotels in the park, this is the only one which has a generator which means after 10:00 PM you  don't have to sweat it out in the dark. This was one of the principal reasons why I chose this hotel. The bathroom was clean and the hot water really hot (during the time it was available). It took me only 5 min. to walk to the park entrance & I was there at 6 AM when it opened. The restaurant in the hotel is not as expensive as the one next door--Tikal Inn. And the food is quite good.  Since my flight from Flores arrived at 7:20 PM, I asked the"
50,"Booked this hotel on the internet on their own website, this means no agency fees. Very reasonably priced but some tourists paid 2 or 3 times my price, in which case too expensive. It was complicated to arrange all my bus journeys but hotel got a cab to meet me at the bus staion and drive me to the site, about 75k. If there had been two of us we would have paid £20 each. I communicated for a couple of weeks about all this and they responded all the time to my emails.    The room, for $45 was very nice indeed, no insects, all hot water, very clean indeed. Freddye at the desk was very helpful. The site itself was about 2 kilometers walk and because I waqs very tired, Jaguar Inn transported me there on a truck. This is usually reserved for the elderly or disabled. It saved a lot of"
40,"We spent one night at Hotel Tikal Inn. The bungalows were very comfortable. They are running on generators so there are only certain hours for power and hot water, but the beds are comfortable and the jungle atmosphere is amazing. Make sure you get up nice and early to experience the park in the early morning."
40,"Basic, clean room. Walking distance to Tikal. Stayed there 1 night for sunrise tour package including dinner and breakfast. Meals were ok. US dollars accepted. WIFI was slow. Staff were helpful. Coffee was provided for sunrise tour."
30,"All a bit basic... no hot water, electricity for 4 hours a day (early morning and early evening), rooms a bit tired... (Wifi only works when electricity on and is v slow)...  BUT food is pretty good, our guide on sunrise tour was great and Tikal is a MUST and staying in the park is definitely a great thing to do... there's three hotels so take your pick...  It has a big pool, but I'd have preferred a hot shower!"
50,"Staying at Tikal Inn for 2 days/1 night was an adventure, it just wasn't quite long enough. The hotel website does not mislead you, it is a clean hotel in the jungle. They run off of generators, so you get lights, ceiling fan, hot water and wifi (in lobby) for a few hours in the evening. It was quite humid while we were there so the cold showers were refreshing in the afternoon.   We had a room in the El Ranchon building, which is a short walk through the jungle from the main building. You do hear the most amazingly loud (ok, scary) noises at night. The helpful staff is willing to mimic and identify them for you.  The Sunrise Hike into Tikal is an absolute must! Our Guide set up thru Tikal Inn was amazing, his knowledge of Mayan History and culture is far beyond what you would"
50,"My family and I traveled to Tikal at the end of January and we could not have been more happy with Hotel Tikal Inn.  We loved everything about it .  The bungalows were comfortable and very cozy.  There was a beautiful swimming pool, but as it is not heated we did not swim because the weather was a little cooler.  We did not have any problem with the fact that the power was only available in the morning and at night.  We stayed here 2 nights and were treated very well by all the staff.  We went on the sunrise tour with a guide and loved every minute of it.  He took his time and made sure that we saw things that only someone on a tour would see.  We had heard that Roxy was the best guide and we were hoping that she would have been our guide, but it was still a great morning.  Roxy"
50,"First of all, given the location in the middle of the jungle this hotel was very impressive to me.  Im not snobby when it comes to hotels, sure the water pressure was a little weak and the food was not Michelin quality 5*, but gooo enjoy the scenery. I stayed in suite 05, and it was absolutely impeccable. The room was perfectly clean and not a single bug, I have to believe the mosquito net is just for show. The outdoor shower (there is also an indoor one) was amazing, bed was comfortable and living area spacious. We also enjoyed some downtime by the beautiful pool while watching monkeys and hummingbirds.  Now, the real reason I give this hotel 5*... the service and people... Starting with our driver from the Flores airport (Jorge). He was very friendly, and made a few stops for"
50,"Jungle Lodge is a surprisingly nice hotel given its location in the jungle. Rooms are large and comfortable and beds are equipped with mosquito nets, although we didn't feel the need. The restaurant serves very well prepared meals. The location within the park can't be beat. Pricier than most hotels in the area, but all combined, worth it in my opinion. The power gets turned off in the afternoon and between 10pm and 6am, so you need to plan your device charging and bring a flashlight."
50,"Despite, the limited availability of electricity in certain parts of the day, the place is great to visit Tikal. The park is just 100 m from the hotel. The rooms are quite fine and the restaurant has good food and acceptable prices. Very friendly service. I asked them a take-away breakfast and it was prefectly ready in the morning. The pool is a nice to have for a mid-day break.  Things to improve: internet is not very good and the mosquito net in the room was more a decoration than anything else. Luckily there were not many mosquitos  decoration: modern bathroom: new/well maintained shower: lime accumulates reducing water pressure bed: not too firm, quite good for my taste pillow: soft"
50,"Absolutely fell in love with the Jungle Lodge. We loved the staff, we feel we've become friends with all of them, their smiley faces and contagious laughs will forever warm my heart.  The rooms were spot on, clean and beautiful, worth paying a bit more for the suites if its in your budget!  "
20,"This is a very expensive hotel considering the standard rates in Guatemala (not just the room rates - every service the hotel provides is expensive) but the service is not justifing the price: no hot water in the shower, wifi wasn't working and the cieling fan in the room started to make a terrible noise in the middle of the night which made it almost impossible to sleep.  I guess the place still have some advantages comparing to the other hotels in the park: there is electricity in the rooms through the night. Also dinner was good and generous."
20,"I had a hard time with the cleanliness of the room. Our bathroom had a wade of hair stuck to the wall. The room did not look like the website photos. There were no swan towels on the bed. The towels hard and although once white, now very grey and hard. The toilet would not flush and thank goodness I had read about this in another reviewers post. I simply used the garbage pail to get water to fill the toilet before flusing and it worked! Our daughter stayed in the room next door and I asked her if the room was like some of the hostels she had been staying in during her travels. Her response was, "" this is the most luxurious place we have stayed in yet!"" Ok, so it maybe this place is ok for the student backpacker crowd but not so much for their parents. I must say that they have"
40,"Stayed again at the Jaguar Inn again on my 10 return visit to Tikal with friends that had not been. Of the 3 locations to stay in Tikal; Jungle Lodge, Tikal Inn and the Jaguar, cost and amenities wise, you can't beat the Jaguar. Rooms are good size. Nice hammock to relax in right outside you cabana. Hot water for showers. The restaurant has great food.   Something I hadn't done before is consult with front desk about a guide for an early morning hike for sunrise. Roxy, the best guide in Tikal was not available. However, Samuel (Chino), the gentleman recommended by the front desk was fantastic. I will certainly be requesting Samuel when we return again in February."
40,"A small hotel of 20 or so bungalows - I didn´t have high expectations out in the jungle, but the rooms are large, the best hot water shower I have had in Guatemala, there are no mosquitoes in the room, there is a nice little restaurant which isn't overly expensive (although some what lacking in choice), staff are freindly, they have lighting 24hrs, they exchange dollars at a rate not too far off the bank rate - I can´t really complain for the price. If you get a chance I would highly recommend staying in Tikal for a night or two. It is good to get up and do the popular sites before 9 and after 3 when most of the tours aren't around. Temple IV at sunset or sunrise is a life time experience."
40,"First things first, you can't beat the location. You're a short, 10-minute walk from the main entrance. It's extremely convenient and much better than having to travel back-and-forth from Flores or another location.   The food in the restaurant was ok, albeit a little pricey. The service was fair. Friendly enough, though the front-desk manager wasn't willing to switch us from a three-bed room to one with a single bed big enough for two.  Be advised, there are plenty of bugs in the jungle, so pack bug spray. The electricity gets shut off at 10 pm (or so) and it can get quite boring at that point, so be prepared. Carry a lot of water with you, as it is hot and humid.   We planned to stay 2 nights, but only stayed one. We went in June and Tikal was empty (We only saw 30 other"
40,"I stayed there for just one night, but would've loved to stay at least one more. Rooms are pretty basic, but clean in every sense, particularily the bathrooms, which are quite a big deal for me. Energy runs 24-7 (unless there's some problem) and location is perfect: 15 minute walk from the pyramids. Just one suggestion: service. It isnt bad at all, just 100% basic. Some people might like that arguing privacy, but I do prefer the home-like service. Talk, ask about your day, etc."
50,"The reviews by mfsinger2015 and Simon K (and others) sum up the pros and cons well.  A traveler seeking a posh resort, fine dining or night life, and a basic view of the Mayan ruins, will be happier staying in Flores and visisiting Tikal as a day trip.  To view the ruins at leisure - both with and without a guide - and to see the birds, animals and jungle, one should stay in the park for at least two nights.  We stayed in a bungalow in January 2015.  Our room was spacious, comfortable, clean, modern and uncluttered.  We had a jungle-facing bungalow (B10) and sat on our porch watching birds and mammals all around.  The swimming pool is very nice: long enough to really swim and perfect after walking through the ruins on a sunny afternoon.  The pool and bungalows were features that"
40,"Efficient hotels that  offers excellent service, comfortable and clean , yet simple rooms, and amazing surroundings. The better choice for hotels in the park. I left something behind and the staff here went to all ends to help me retrieve it from afar. Very nice."
50,"The Tikal Inn, where we stayed as a couple in January 2015, was an amazing experience.  The tour books had recommended being inside the park in order to have easy access.  Tikal Inn fits that bill to a T.  It sits on the edge of the jungle, a short walk from the archaeological reservation and ruins.  We had planned to come for just a couple of days and ended up extending our stay because the experience was so rich.  We had a bungalow with a front porch that allowed us to enjoy ostentatious turkeys morning and night, toucans, aricaris, hummingbirds, spider monkeys, coati mundi, and many more creatures throughout the days.  Roxy Ortiz manages the hotel and is also an amazing naturalist as well as being an archaeologist who knows Tikal like the back of her hand.  She is available"
40,"Of you want to feel the real Tikal experience this is the place to be. Sure they only have electricity for  4 or 5 hours a day... You are minutes away from the first of the temples, great dawn walks. Super sunsets, an extremely clean and refreshing swimming pool and good clean basic rooms.  If you're only in Tikal for a day or two save on travel time and stay here. Its about 30 mins to the edge of the Tikal area. There is a great zip wire place at the  entrance/exit which is worth a go - safe and we got really close to howler monkeys"
40,"The Hotel Tikal Inn is still my favorite of all locations at the park ( 25 years)  and yes, you DO want to stay at the park. Every animal encounter is precious and most of my best ones have been on the grounds of this family owned, ""We try harder!"",  hotel.  You are a lot of miles from big stuff, so please take joy in the patchy network, the lack of 24/7 electricity (and they have thankfully installed a light available for your use in each room, even when the electricity is not on). Take joy in the jungle animals that frequent the grounds ( spider monkeys, piscotes, toucans, agouti etc!!! I once saw a troop of  at least 2 dozen piscotes frolic on the hotel lawn, enjoying a search for grub in the grass around the pool.  The family who owns the Tikal Inn is full of winners. Roxy,"
50,"We are staying the night here so that we can tour the ruins in the morning. I have been to Tikal twice before, and both times stayed in the park. I have memories of hot, uncomfortable nights in rooms full of bugs. I picked this based on the reviews and it has been amazing. We paid for the master suite and it is beyond what I was expecting. So beautiful and comfortable! After having stayed in places all over Guatemala, the attention to quality and detail is very appreciated. We would definitely choose to stay here again. "
40,"+ location + swimming pool + staff o money for value (in comparison with average income in Guatemala)  You need to know, that electrical power is just in the morning and in the evening. As well there is no wifi in the rooms."
50,"The lodge was at a perfect location in the park.  The room was very comfortable with a large walk in shower.  The restaurant was excellent with a wonderful presentation.  The people were very pleasant and accommodating.  I would definitely stay there again if I was going to visit Tikal.  Make sure you arrive at 3 pm as we had to wait 3 hours I. Order not to pay for two days in the park.  After 3, you only pay for 1 day but have both the afternoon and the next day until 1 pm which gives you lots of time to explore the park which is amazing.  "
50,"Room was clean and recently renovated.  Hotel staff was very knowledgeable and courteous.  We hired a guide at the lodge who took us to see the sunrise at Tikal from the top of Pyramid 4 and later to the Mayan Ruins of Uaxactun about 30 minutes north of the hotel.  The downside of our stay was that the power to our room was only on from 1-2pm and 5:30-10pm each day and there was no air-conditioning anywhere on the property.  But we did not come for the comforts of home, so it was just a part of our adventure to Guatemala.  The swimming pool was very nice and we had WiFi service in the lobby, restaurant, and pool areas.  My wife and I would definitely stay here again."
50,The staff was friendly and helpful. They assisted our basic Spanish with a very good staff that spoke english well. They were personable and knowledgeable about the Tikal ruins and the local culture.  The wifi only works in the main lodge or nearby and the electricity is cut at night due to constant power generation as the only source of power to the facility. The fans do work at night. A small amount of planning will keep the batteries charged well. Nicolasa was a fantastic waitress and I suggest looking her up. 
50,"Knowing that we would not electricity, hot water, etc. for the vast majority of the day, I was not expecting much. I figured I was paying a high price for the most basic of accommodations simply because we were within the park. When I arrived, I was really impressed. The place is beautiful, and while we were there, the weather was so comfortable that not having air conditioning was not at all a problem. The pool was nice and clean, the bed comfortable. We had a pool-side bungalow which was fantastic. The shuttle was safe and convenient.  The restaurant was ok, not bad but not great. The wifi situation also wasn't the best, but other than making it difficult to figure out our next plans, we didn't mind that at all because who wants to spend their vacation sitting on a computer. "
30,This hotel is OK at best. The food is alright. The service is less than average. The rooms are decent. But the location is excellent. You're right in the jungle and minutes from the ruins. This close proximity allows you to do either (or both) the sunrise and sunset tours.
20,"This hotel advertises the package deal of room, breakfast, dinner and sunrise and sunset tours of the ruins. This is the only option at this hotel and it is quite expensive for the outdated, fan-cooled rooms, limited hours electricity, and mediocre food on offer. I am carefully separating out the amazing location of the Hotel Tikal Inn (inside the park, a short walk from the entrance to the ruins area) and the hotel itself as a place to stay. The positives are the lovely staff trying to make the best of a not so great situation, the overall good maintenance of the exterior, and the cleanliness of the rooms. there are two sections of the hotel that rooms group around: the pool and the garden. The swimming pool is huge and beautiful. Just the thing after a long day exploring the"
50,"We had a great two nights stay, the purpose of our visit; to be at the site for sunset and sunrise,and both where superb. We where we'll informed by their booking office, and assistance was vital to make land connections from Belize City to Tikal. We enjoyed every minute of our time at Tikal, and the overnight at the Ranchos room,they where where something else, first night very spooky kind like since you are far away from the main installations, and the sounds of the forest, and wildlife are incredible, just outside your door.  Food; we didn't come for the food but we had a good experience, the staff was always helpful and courteous.  We will definitely be back to enjoy more of Tikal and stay at this hotel. Something you most have in mind you come to a jungle friendly"
40,"Good: 1) Access to the park. Most visitors only go to the park once. We went in the morning with a guide, had breakfast and a nap, and went back into the park in the afternoon by ourselves. The morning guide was AMAZINGLY informative and patient. Our solo afternoon adventure was great, especially since our guide was so adept at explaining the park layout and archaeology in the morning. At times it felt like we had the whole park to ourselves, and thanks to our guide we had the knowledge to really enjoy it. Again, amazing. We could not have done the above if we stayed in Flores instead of at Tikal. 2) Toucans. If you learn their call, you'll see them around the hotel grounds! 3) Cleanliness. The rooms and the pool were spotless. 4) Front desk. I found them polite and helpful. "
30,"The hotel is good enough for a short stay ... basic accomodation, quiet and clean  Be prepared for no air con and if you must have it stay up the road. Lets face it when your trecking through the jungle to Tikal you really shouldnt worry too much about staying cool (take plenty of water)  The staff are great and could even understand my poor Spanish. Didnt matter their English was excellent and they even gave me a few small Spanish lessons  Have fun and stay safe in Guatemala :-)"
40,"Yes, there are 3 places to stay within walking distance to the ruins.  Jaguar does not have a pool and I missed that in the middle of the day.  Seems like the hotel next door let you jump in theirs for a small fee, no big deal.  If you want to see Tikal, take this plunge at Hotel Jaguar.  Food, very good, accomdations very good, a little primitive for some people and too fancy or expensive for ones that would rather sleep on the ground or try the jungle experience. But, spent lots of time in the jungle and I've spent more on a Holiday Inn in the states with less satisfaction.  You can sleep comfortably at this place and take in a 15 mile walk in a day at Tikal and eat good in the evening. I was there during late Dec, best time to go to Guatemala.  Be aware that howlers will"
50,"We were nervous about the electricity after reading some reviews - we knew we were going to be there during a pretty hot time, and didn't know if we were going to be too hot to sleep. Thankfully, the ceiling fans worked all night long and kept us nice and cool!  Everyone we met from Jaguar Inn was very nice and helpful. The rooms were clean and the hammocks were a great place to relax at the end of the day.  It is situated very close to the park entrance, so it was possible to get up really early, visit the park and come back for a siesta when it got too hot."
20,"Room seemed okay, but when we went to bed, small beetle like bugs started coming out of little holes in the walls.  We discovered bugs in the bed and we ended up sleeping on top of the covers with our clothes on.  Not an ideal night for a 5am sunrise wakeup call.  We told the front desk, but they didn't reimburse us or seem to care too much.   This was in September of 2010."
40,"We got what we needed here, and that was a fantastic nights sleep in Tikal so we could do the very early morning tour.   Rooms are basic and clean. Beds are good, restaurant food not so good. It's was less expensive than other places though.   The highlight of our stay was our early morning guide, Julio Tot. Julio, if you read this, thank you so so much for being the best cultural guide we have ever had the pleasure of being with. None of the other guides seemed as passionate to teach and chat as Julio. We take great memories of his trip home with us.   "
40,"An adventure in the Jungle!!!   We think that spending a night in this place is a must.  Most people come to Tikal on a day tour from Flores.  If for a sunrise tour then they should wake up very early and have  1.5 hours ride.  If not,  then they arrive for the hot hours.  A night in Tikal makes life much easier.   But forget about the logistics issues.   The place is marvelous and deserve a night for itself.   Nothing compares to live in the Jungle and hearing the Jungle go to sleep and wake up.   The place is nice,  rooms are very good.  Electricity goes down at 10 pm but some of the rooms have an electricity to the fun and its bulb.   Just don't try to book something from them,  they will rob you.  Just go 100 meters down the road to the reservation entrance and book the"
40,"Luxury in the middle of the rainforest! Electricity is turned off at 10pm so make sure you plan for this. Great breakfast but overpriced drinks, wifi not always working. Beautiful pool area and rooms. Check everything for bugs - we found a scorpion in one of the rooms!"
30,"First what I loved about this hotel was the setting.  What I didn't love about this was the service.  If you every wanted anything, you had to go look for someone to help you and they weren't very helpful, even making us look for the room ourselves, which was difficult to find in the rain.  It was raining profusely, and we couldn't get anyone to offer any help, it was like the help staff disappeared.  the room was fine, but no internet.  Even in the reception, it was hard to keep connection to send an email and was  full of people.  I have to keep up with emails for my work, so it was essential to have internet. The rooms are OK, but not great.  I've stayed here before and felt the same thing.  We stayed there to do the early morning trip to see the sunrise, but with the rain,"
50,"We loved our one night at Tikal Jungle Lodge. We ate in the restaurant and were happy with the vegetarian options. Our cabin was, as described by others, lovely and modern. We found the mosquitos not to be a problem and the fan seemed to be on all night. The pool is perfect for a dip and lounging after one's tour . A great place to stay when visiting Tikal."
40,I travelled with my daughter and decided to stay overnight rather than do the day tour out of Guatemala City. I'm glad we did! The location right in the park meant we could stroll in at dusk for a view of the temples AND do the early morning sunrise tour. I'm glad we didn't stay in Flores as that is about an hour away and seeing the sunrise would have meant a 3am start!!!! We had a cute two bed cabin complete with mosquito nets (I needn't have packed one) and impressive bathroom. The food was a lot better than I expected having read some other reviews. There's a nice pool. The hotel arranged airport transfers for us.  Note though that the wifi is hopeless - which is fine for a night but not if you're counting on it - we weren't.   The one disappointment was the sunrise tour of
30,"Rooms were clean.  We had hot water and electric.  The restaurant was also very affordable and the food was good.  The breakfast menu is exceptional and the outdoor patio is quite nice.  Best of all, it is just a 300 ft walk to the entrance to the park."
30,"We stayed 1 night visiting f/ Belize, the reception area wasn""t the friendliest but got the job done.  Expensive for what we got BUT Rooms were decient. nothing fancy, clean bed and bathroom... Not much to do after dark so we walked to the hotel next door and had dinner by their pool which had THE best service we experienced on our whole 2 week vacation... Breakfast at the Jag was great the next morning!!!   TIP GET UP EARLY and hike the park before the tours come in!"
40,"This place was beautiful.  It is located right next to the entrance to Tikal National Park, and in a 2-minute walk.  I had read a few bad reviews before coming, so I did not know what to expect.  I was so pleased that I disregarded them in favor of the postive reviews that I read.  The entire place is stunning and the people were amazing.  One of the guys who was at reception, named Mauricio, was so cool that we actually named our son after him, that and because we like the name, too :-)  He was very friendly and helped us set up all types of wonderful excursions.  He also prepared a wonderful chocolate cake for a surprise birthday party for my girlfriend.  The sunrise tour from the top of the Temples is a must do.  Just be ready to go early in the morning, and you should have"
30,"Jaguar Inn is a good place to base yourself when exploring the Tikal ruins.  The rooms are very basic but you don't need anything fancy, a bed and a hot shower in the morning. One night is enough in Tikal, you only need to see the ruins during the day and perhaps book a sunrise tour.  Then get the next shuttle out of there.  Staff are friendly enough.  They were happy for me to hang around while I waited for my shuttle."
20,"Expensive, but a 2 min walk to the park.  Very money grabbing and badly organised. Avoid the 7usd transfer to Flores if you can, the company the inn use are a joke"
30,"For us, this place was a splurge.  We wanted to be able to experience the park at sunrise, so we went for it. The dinner/breakfast/sunrise tour package is a reasonable deal for one night. The hotel setting is beautiful and quiet at night, aside from the welcoming sounds of the jungle.  The food is pretty good, though very expensive, and the bed was very comfortable. Note that the hotel is technically INSIDE the boundaries of the park and you have to pay the full Q150/person just to get to your hotel.  If you wait until 4pm your ticket will also be good the next day.  The staff seemed friendly, though they later ended up being very unhelpful.  The electricity in the hotel is on during part of the morning and part of the evening. Hot water, lights, and wifi are limited to those"
50,"Of the three hotels inside the park at Tikal, Tikal Inn is in the middle range of the choices. Only a fe muntes walk and you are inside the ruins.   The gardens are beautiful and very well kept. The howler monkeys may pay a visit in the trees above. The swimming pooll is clean and well maintained. Very refreshing after a long, hot walk inside the park.   The food is good even with a rather limited menu. Prices are very reasonable.  Service is very good. WIFI is available for free.  Be aware the poer goes out during certain hours. The staff will inform you of this so you can work around any inconvenience. This is not unique to just this hotel so consider it a norm."
40,"When buying a tour package to Tikal National Park, I recommend a one night stay at the Tikal Inn.  If more than one night, a stay in Flores will give you more choices of entertaining and restaurants.  The Tikal Inn is situated inside the National Park and at the end of the parking lot at the park near the ruins.  It is a few minutes walk to the guarded entrance of the park with a nice swimming pool to relax after the long walk from the ruin site.  The hotel is clean and the staff are efficient and helpful. staff at the restaurant and the reception desk were very patient and polite and helpful, The room is very simple charming and the main building has thatch roof with glass panes for sun light. Food is excellent which are mostly Guatemalan style and some of sandwiches.  Free"
40,"We stayed here over Christmas and had a great time. It was really convenient being right inside the park. Unfortunately the weather didn't cooperate with us and there wasn't a sun rise on our sunrise tour. Our guide that we had from the Inn made up for that though, he was great!  The rooms were nice and clean and the food was ok. It was cool to hear the animals waking up in the morning. This place was a bit too pricey for us and I kind of wished we had stayed in Flores, we weren't sure if we could get transport into the park on Christmas which is why we stayed there. Apparently it was possible to get in on Christmas day though. We paid $111 US for a private room and that included a tour and breakfast and dinner.   If you are only in Tikal for one or two days I would recommend"
30,"I'll start with the positives, as everyone says, the location is at the entrance to the ruins. they are a 25 minute walk away. the staff was great ,courteous ,helpful,.the room was clean and nice size, the shower is not hot, a small sacrifice for this location. now the negatives, built in the 60's? the place reminded me of many of the u.s. national park hotels, in desperate need of an overhaul! design, layout etc, this property could be so much more with just a little attention.overall an enjoyable stay and the pool was nice after a long day."
40,"We spent just 2 nights at the Jungle lodge, mostly for the full experience of the jungle. It was great! Our 13 and 16 yr old sons LOVED that there were monkeys swinging through the trees directly over our porch as well as in the trees above the pool. We also could clearly hear the sounds of the howler monkeys at night. We did have an unexpected visitor, which was a 4 inch long SCORPION, that simply walked under the door to our room. We chased it out and plugged the crack with a towel and things were fine after that. It is the jungle, after all. The restaurant was on the pricey side for Guatemala, but there are two other hotels to eat at, as well as the Tikal Comedor nearby, which was good. Overall, we had good service. BTW, The wifi only works well by the pool. They also have"
50,"This is a great place to stay with a wonderful location and several options for your visit.  It is a Hostel with shared bathrooms and showers but they also have private cabins with private bathrooms.   We, chose the hostel option.  It was the most affordable and it was very nice.  There were very few other guests so the bathrooms were just for us anyway.  They were clean and well lit. Well stocked and always had flowers in the vases.    The pool was a nice place to go after a long day of exploring and climbing ruins.  We pretty much had the place to ourselves.  We saw others at the restaurant but that was about it.   The restaurant, is excellent.  The staff is very attentive and accommodating as well as bilingual so communication wasn't a problem.  The food was great the"
30,"I liked the jungle lodge. It is a good experience in terms of really getting a feel of the jungle in Tikal and also being very close to all of the Mayan Temples. It's amazing to hear the howler monkeys and see all of the wild life all over!   However, you should be prepared for heat! Major hot weather and no air conditioner. It is a true lodge experience. Also, don't forget that with all jungle comes little scorpions etc.   The pool is gorgeous and nice! The food is a bit over priced so make sure you bring your own water in!!!!! Preferably a cooler. The staff is not very helpful and definitely not knowledgable as to their surroundings! They know now history.   Make certain you schedule the tour guide yourself so that the hotel doesn't overcharge you for the service. Also if you"
50,"I was delighted of this place Jungle Lodge Tikal, its location, its rooms with great elegance, your meals, your drinks and especially the friendliness of the staff as they are attentive and Immediately ask if I need something more and have a service at the pool which is lovely, you can order mojitos and caipirinhas drinks relaxing after a walk through the center of tikal park and is very wonderful to hear the sound of birds, howler monkeys walking in the trees of the rooms and insects that exist in a variety of course that the immensity of the jungle and my young children explored the corners of the box to observe many insects.  I recommend this hotel without hesitation is positively charming because it is only 10 minutes from the central square"
30,"This lodge is all about location as it provides an easy walk to Tikal.  Unfortunately that can also be a bad thing as the lodge has clearly relied too much on it's location.  The food is terrible,  I tried breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and nothing was fresh with most items being re-heated and re-hydraid from frozen or from a can.  But then with this location you have few options.  And if you would like an after dinner drink outside  or an early morning cup of coffee the staff was put off and quite rude. No charm or vibe here, it's largely commercialized.  But the rooms are clean and fairly nice with a location that can not be beat.  So you have a choice to make, do you prefer the simplicity of a short 5 minute walk to explore Tikal, or do you prefer an edible meal with a staff"
50,"I rank this hotel with the ""excellent"" review considering where it is. The location is everything. The hotel is clean and everything worked fine for us. We stayed one night. The bed was hard, that would be my only complaint. The price combined with location makes it good value.   They were helpful with exchanging money at the Jaguar Inn, giving a better rate than the money changers at the border from Belize. The front Desk staff had perfect English. The didn't let us check in until after 2:00 although they held our luggage at the desk, no problem.  We did not do the sunrise or sunset tours as they were VERY Expensive and typically the fog is to dense to have a good sunrise. We did however get up at 5:00 and listened to the jungle wake up as we got ready. We got let in through"
30,"While there was nothing really wrong about the Jaguar, I think if I had to do it again, I may stay elsewhere (like El Ramate).   The toilet in Bungalow 8, where we stayed, didn't flush properly so anytime there was a, uh, larger deposit, we had to manually fill the tank so that things could flush. While the location is great in that yes, it's in the park, you are, as I'm sure you're aware, quite captive when it comes to food.  It was pretty overpriced for what you got. We did manage to escape to a comodore for breakfast though (the only one that was open)."
30,My husband and I spent one evening at Jaguar Inn. The service for booking a room and on arrival was excellent. The location is perfect - just steps away from the entrance to the park.  We were immediately informed about the sunset and sunrise tour. We asked around for other prices but could not better the price so booked the joint tours. It was so worth every cent. The sunrise tour was incredible- the best sunrise of my life. We met the guide at 4am and experienced so much more than if we had entered the park only at 6am.  The Inn itself was neat. The restaurant was being sprincleaned when we were there. Our room 1A was neat and clean. No bedbugs as previously reported.  Large kingsize bed. Our one issue with Jaguar Inn was the smell in the room. It had an intensely mouldy
40,"We spent three days (two nights) at Tikal. The Jaguar Inn was perfect for us because we could get up and go into the park at 6am to see the awakening animals at sunrise.  After several hours of hiking and climbing , we could have lunch, take a nap and then spend until closing at 6 pm, back in the park for sunset.  Fabulous."
40,Recently stay for one night with several friends and spouse. The staff was super friendly and helpful. They knew we where on our honeymoon and they left flowers on the bed in the shape of a heart as well as sending over a bottle of wine to our dinner table. Good vibe with other travelers as well. Easy walking access to Tikal Park. Would stay again if visiting Tikal.
40,You can't beat walking from the Tikal Inn to the fabulous Tikal ruins early in the morning before the busloads arrive.  The Inn itself needs some updating.  Our rooms in the central lodge were spacious and utilitarian but not exciting.  The grounds are well cared for and the pool is good.  The cottages in the jungle are many meters away from the dining room and moldy smelling but the proximity of the night sounds make it seem like camping.  The service staff is young and friendly.  The breakfasts are ok and the dinners average but improve if there is freshly bought fish on the menu. p.s. the highlight was a birding/archeology tour with Roxy who is amazingly knowledgeable-- probably the best guide we encountered in 24 days in Central America.
40,"We stayed for 3 nights with breakfast and dinner included.  Our cabana was very clean and nice.  Well-screened to keep out the bugs.  The staff was great, very helpful.  The waiters helped me to practice my Spanish and were very patient with me.  The fellows at the desk were helpful too.  We left before breakfast for our trip home and they gave us a breakfast to go.  The food is pretty good, freshly made.  I was happy there were several choices for vegetarians.  Try the hot sauce!  The location of the hotel in the park is awesome, allowing you to do the sunrise tour and to visit the ruins at quiet times. The pool is very refreshing after a humid hike.   We would very much recommend this place."
30,"It's a little pricey, but I guess it's to be expected since the place is inside the park. It's also convenient as you can walk out and start hiking straight away. It was especially good for us as the weather was pretty crappy, so we would go back to the hotel when it was raining, and then head back out. We were in C-9 right next to restaurant which was a bit annoying as you can hear the noise from the kitchen and restaurant. Kitchen staff are awesome though Manuel, Edgar & Elio. They made the experience very nice to eat in the restaurant. Electricity is from 6am-8am and 6pm-10pm, so you need to charge your cameras etc at those times. Everything is damp. Windows and mirrors are rusty from the dampness. Ceiling fan felt like it was gonna fly off it was so old. 4am sunrise tour and"
50,"Tikall is a magic place, and this hotel is complementary with that magic. Totalle recommended. Nice Pool, nice rooms and the personnal so great. The location is perfect, next to the Mayan ruins. Sunset tour and dawn tour are the best."
40,"The Tikal Inn is IN the park, which makes it great!  A few things about being IN the park:  there is limited electricity:  9a-1p, and 6p-9p daily,,,,give or take a 1/2 hour or so.  This must be why it takes so long to get a response....  If you arrive at night, you pay the park fee 150Q on the way in...they date it for the next day, IF you get up early for the sunrise tour (Recommended), you have to pay an additional 50Q park fee for going in early.  The hotel is quite basic, you need to time your shower time to be within the 'electricity' times, but the check out time is a bit early...would recommend they extend that to at least 12n....especially since the hotel shuttle doesn't leave until 3-4pm.  Food there was pretty good, smaller selection, but good.  Rooms were basic.  Nice"
40,"We stayed here for two nights while visiting the Tikal ruins. I must say, the stay was very good and comfortable. The Lodge consists of about thirty or so rooms in cabins spread throughout the jungle compound -- generally two separate  rooms to a cabin.  The Lodge is close to the park's entrance yet separated from the visitors center, museum and parking lots. It is quiet and idyllic.  I must stress that these are not your typical jungle shanties that pass themselves off as jungle lodges.  These rooms are modern, spacious, with fans and separate bathrooms. Our Junior Suite had both a tub and a shower.  There is also a nice pool on the premises which has an adjoining  bar that offers daily 2 for 1 deals on some beers or drinks.  Swimmingly peaceful!  As with all hotels at Tikal,"
50,"The jungle lodge is right next to the entrance of the park so you can easily walk in and out throughout the day if you want to go back to the hotel for lunch or a swim in the pool in the afternoon.  We stayed in the ""hostel"" part of the lodge with shared bathrooms which looked new and were kept extremely clean.  The room was very comfortable too (note no air conditioning but we didn't feel hot).  The grounds are beautiful with nice gardens and flowers.  There is only power at certain times of the day and goes off at 10pm.  There is wifi in the lobby but it was a little slow.  The food is on the pricey side but you don't really have much of a choice for meals except a small eatery just outside the park next to the museum, but they also have similar prices.  The staff was really"
50,"Our visit here started with a friendly email from the lodge confirming our stay. We stayed in the twin rooms with shared facilities. Found the bathroom and shower to be clean, convenient and well-maintained. The room was perfect for a good night's sleep.   The grounds were beautiful!! It feels as if you are genuinely in the jungle. The wildlife is often just there... Beyond reach (a safe distance away) but definitely visible and heard. We saw howler monkeys, spider monkeys, toucans! Just beautiful! The pool was a very welcome spot to cool off.   Another great part of the lodge is its proximity to the park. You step out of the hotel grounds and just on the right is the park. Makes it very easy to explore Tikal at off-peak hours in the morning and afternoon when the crowds are"
40,"A friend and I, on our very last minute unplanned backpack through parts of Guatemala decided to stay here. It was the last place on our trip, we spent a fair bit on a flight to Tikal rather than lose a day driving, so we opted for a cheaper room. We got a 2 bed room with shared bathroom. Not our favourite thing (sharing accomodations) but the hotel is absolutely worth it!  The property is fantastic. There are plenty of spots to relax alone or around other people. It was VERY hot so the pool was great to have.   This is a wildlife heaven! We were spotting and surrounded by toucans, spider monkeys, parrots, blue morpho butterflies and the sounds of howler monkeys.  This hotel is right at the entrance of the National Park, and a short walk in gets you to the pyramids. When we were"
50,"The staff here were very friendly and even set up coffee for us the night before our sunrise Tikal walk. The food at the restaurant is good, though a little on the pricey side (fair given the location!). Beds were comfortable and the rooms basic, but the hotel was a perfect base for exploring Tikal. The pool was well kept and an incredible treat to dive into after a morning in the hot and humid jungle. Would highly recommend for anyone seeking a place to explore Tikal from."
10,"You get what you pay for. Tents are cheap but next to the bathroom. The nighttime security staff was abominable. At night, someone was spying under the door of the shower. Either one of the staff members was a peeping tom or they let a peeping tom stranger inside the confines of the hotel. Either way, the tent area is not a safe location, which may be indicative of the hotel in general.Can't speak for the private rooms.In short, unbeatable prices, abhorrent ethics. Breakfast was a nice addition though."
50,"This hotel was really great. We stayed just one night just to do the sunrise tour, which was one of the best things we did in Guatemala. The Jaguar inn was perfect for a one night splurge after some weeks of backpacking! It was clean with warm water! Perfect! We heard howler monkeys calling from our room, really neat expierence. Our guide met us at 3am in the lobby which was great.. the guards were great about it! Would highly recommend staying here if you want to do Tikal right! Suggest using the ""bird man"" as a guide too,.. he was very knowledgable!"
50,"My Fiance and I have been travelling around Guatemala for the past 5 weeks and decided to spend 1 night up at Tikal so we could have an afternoon/sunset in the park, as well as a sunrise/morning there the following day.  We stayed at Jaguar Inn and we VERY pleasantly surprised when we arrived.  Such a great place!!  Very comfortable and clean, great location, beautiful surroundings, hot water.........we loved it.     Yes the prices are higher here than in most of Guatemala, but so worth it to have that early morning in the park before the tour buses start arriving.  Jaguar Inn was so comfortable, I would definitely recommend it to others."
50,"I wanted to have plenty of time in Tikal so stayed at the Jaguar Inn for four nights.  When I read some of the negative reviews, I have to wonder if they stayed at the same place!  I had a great experience all the way around.  My room featured a king-sized bed, good quality furniture, excellent bed and bedding and great bathroom.  The front porch had a seat and a hammock.    The food was excellent, I thought, with a good variety.  Yes, it is priced more than some locations in Guatemala but if you consider how remote the location is, it is understandable.  Everything I had was well-cooked with good quality ingredients.  The staff couldn't have been nicer.  There are no cleaning ""ladies"" only cleaning ""men"" who do an excellent job of keeping things clean both inside and out.  They"
30,"Great location. Right by the entrance to the site, and a just 15min walk to temple1 and the start of the adventure! Hotel restaurant offered a good menu, although a little pricey, had no problems with the food. Staff were fine, and their english was good, better then my spanish. Room was fine, nothing to write home about, average. We just slept there, spent most of the time in the park."
50,"The Jungle Lodge in Tikal was a great experience, not only for the great hospitality of the staff but also the exposure to natural in this small little Eco Resort in the Jungle! Ask for Niki, great person."
50,"Although the hotel is right in the jungle it's very comfortable and luxurious. It's true power is only available at certain times, and yes it's hot at night with no AC and the fan stops when the power stops. We found our rooms to be very comfortable with lovely bathrooms. The food in the restaurant was excellent. We loved being able to enter the ruins early in the morning, and then return to the hotel late morning to have lunch and a swim, and then return later in the day. While in the pool we heard howler monkeys and a variety of birds. In Tikal itself we saw very few people, especially away from the central plaza. We arrived at Tikal NP at 3pm the first day to take advantage of the entry ticket that would carry on through to the next day, essentially giving us 1.5 days in the"
50,"We stayed in one of the larger bungalows and the room was absolutely spectacular.  The hardwood furniture and ceiling, the pictures on the walls, the old spot light lamp fixture, the mosquito netting around the beds, and the high ceilings made the room look like something from an old movie or a furniture catalog.  The bathroom was uber cool, the outdoor shower with rain head was amazing.  Just standing there, outside, surrounded by the jungle (while being completely private) looking up at the moon was incredible.  The occasional howler monkey off in the distance was as exotic as possible.  We saw both types of monkeys (spider & howler), a couple of coati, flocks of butterflies, and only a couple of mosquitos near the rooms.  There were some big bugs outside our porch light that"
20,"The hotel is within the park, making it really easy to just get up and walk over before the crowds arrive. There is a restaurant on site and we liked the pool after a hot few hours in the park. We were able to watch monkeys in the trees during our swim. The rooms are really nice, however, the electricity is shut off at night (around midnight) and during the afternoons, making it unbearably hot. Our room had only a ceiling fan that was really high up, so not very useful, and there was no breeze. We did not get any sleep due to the heat and the bugs (even though there was a net over the bed) The hotel staff was helpful by getting us a room in their sister hotel in Flores which was much more comfortable."
50,"Our room was spacious and airy, with a porch to sit outside.  The windows have good screens so there is a nice breeze at night and you can listen to the howler monkeys and other jungle noises.  The pool isn't particularly clean, but it is so beautifully situated and such a welcome respite from the heat that one must accept some imperfections in paradise.  Everything was delightful."
50,"We greatly enjoyed our time at the Tikal Inn.  You have a choice of pool view or jungle view.  I would recommend the jungle view.  We saw 10+ spider monkeys from the chair outside our room.  We also saw coatis and other small mammals.  When we arrived the hotel provided a tour guide of the national park.  He spoke excellent English and was very passionate about his topic. He knew about the commerce, the society, reason behind the structures.  Our three hour tour took four hours- probably because we asked too many questions and he answered them all. In the morning, I took the sunrise tour.  Only five brave souls woke in time to participate.  The tour starts at 4:00 a.m. The first hours is mostly walking in the dark to temple IV.  We spent over an hour on top of temple as the"
10,"I am a native to Guatemala and have traveled this great country for a long time. That said, I have stayed in many hotels and hostels around the country and can honestly say Tikal Inn is the worst experience I have ever had in my life.  	 To start off the price is ridiculous for Guatemalan standards (120USD). I stayed in a hostel in Atitlan for 3USD that was cleaner than Tikal Inn.   Once we got out of the airport and into the shuttle we came across the first problem. The hotel failed to mention that the shuttle would be charged (80USD). You would think with the exorbitant prices they are charging, the shuttle would be complementary. They also failed to mention that the entrance to the park was not covered (22USD p/ person). Did they mention that it was extra to pay for the"
30,"We just got back from an eight day trip to Guatemala and this was the only hotel that we weren't really impressed with. The setting is beautiful, it's surrounded by jungle and near the water, you hear the Howler Monkeys, birds are singing all over, and we even saw a Silver Fox during a morning walk. ,public areas like the lobby and restaurant are updated but the rooms are old- ours had broken, old tile, dirty walls, and the phone didn't work (we wanted to ask for a wake up call,) the power also went out while I was in the shower. Before we got there we had spent the day at Tikal National Park and it was about 90 degrees and super humid so the pool at the hotel was the first place we went, which was much appreciated. When we were there the place was pretty empty so they didn't"
40,"Tikal Inn is a nice place to stay in the center of the Park. I would recommend it because only by sleeping in the center you can enjoy the sunrise tour which is highly recommendable.  We booked a bungalow what is the middle category. Those bungalows are quite pretty and if you get one on the pool-side its even more pretty. The interior is quite plane and a little bit old, but its okay. First night they upgraded us to junior suite, but that room was very plain and without any picture. Seemed to be even older and very cold…So, if you stay there, ask about a bungalow at the pool side! Breakfast is included and typical for Guatemala. Dinner is also included and okay, but nothing very special. You have to pay drinks and lunch and those prices are quite high comparing with the other"
40,The pool is lovely and nice to cool off The grounds are beautiful Wildlife All Around Birds And all kinds of  Critters on the grounds Staff is friendly Rooms clean Food good not excellent but not bad  Loved our room C 9 we could lay in bed and see the stars and hear the howler monkeys  
30,"We stayed here for 2 nights (including New Year´s Eve).  The main reason that we chose this hotel was that it was the cheapest option inside the park (aside from camping), and I would recommend that anyone wanting to truly see Tikal should stay at least one night in the park.  Our rooms were not cleaned AT ALL during our stay, nor were our towels changed.  Since you are basically sleeping in the jungle, humidity is very high, so by our last day, our towels, sheets, clothing...everything started smelling like mold.  We also had arrived from Belize where service was excellent (but slow).  This was not the case at the Jaguar Inn.  The service was just slow, period.  Also, on New Year´s Eve, we were NOT informed that there was a set menu for dinner that cost $20 (normal prices were"
10,"coming from Belize, we stayed here for 1 night. We chose to stay in a tent, because it was the cheaper option. They told us the tents were equipped with  mattress and blankets. After paying, and waiting for several hours, we were taken to our tent, which looked like it had never been cleaned. The staff at the lodge were extremely unpleasant and always trying to make a quick buck. The food was overpriced, arrived cold (every time), and was more or less tasteless. Overall, terrible experience!"
40,"In short, this place was really nice and I'd stay there again.   I was also concerned about bed bugs from previous reveiws, but there were none in our bungalow (#6) at the time of our stay in late Dec.  The hot water was very hit and miss; it seemed to have to do with when other guests were using it. I am sure that if we had reported this as a problem, the staff would have tried to assist us; they were very accommodating and helpful.   There were some bugs and some mold...but not as much as I anticipated given the remote location in the jungle."
40,"i think the most important decision when booking is to decide if you want to stay inside Tikal or if you want to be in Flores.  I am pretty certain i would have enjoyed my time in this region a bit more if I stayed in Flores.  With that said Jaguar Inn was itself a great hotel.  If you are looking to experience being in the Jungle and if you want to opportunity to get into Tikal before it is open to the general public then Jaguar Inn is a great option.  All the rooms at Jaguar Inn are private bungalows with their own private bathroom.  The showers are good, but you only have hot water in between the hours of 6am and 9am and then again at 6pm and 9pm.  While in the park, your only food options are at the three hotels.  The food at Jaguar Inn was pretty typical for Guatemala, but"
30,"I stayed here for 2 nights with my partner. In hindsight, I would have opted for just one.   The good- Great location, had spider monkeys outside my cabana and woke up to the sounds of howler monkeys in the Jungle. It is located right by the parking lot for the park so getting up and getting into the park when it opened (6am) was easy. The bad- Mold everywhere. It was growing on the walls and the pillows were moldy too. Make sure you bring allergy meds or your own pillow.  They claim to have hot water but all you get is a dribble from the shower head that is not consistently hot. Be content with not really showering if you are coming here. This was extra bad for me with all of the mold and the reports of bedbugs.  Reading about the bed bugs made me totally paranoid. I don't"
30,"Accommodations are average and price is high for Guatemala .staff is nice . Food  and drinks pricey! I felt being milked ! But I felt the same in Macchu Picchu in Peru, same in Paris France and other touristic places ! Worth visiting maybe 2 days one nite and leave !  I found as nice in Belize and cheaper in terms of pyramids "
50,"Great location in the park!!  Clean hotel, with great rooms. The bathroom was all glass, including an outdoor shower, and we really did feel you were one with nature. Saw all kinds of wild life and had a great pool.   One draw back, I did not realize there was no electrically.   All the power was on a genearater and only was on certain times of the day and night.   Overall it was a great experience!!"
50,"Ok, the price for the room is a bit high, but... you sleep at the doorstep of Tikal! It's a 1 minute walk to the entrance of Tikal (and a 20 minute walk in Tikal to the first temples...). Nearly all the tourist stay in Tikal and make a day trip. We stayed 3 nights in the Jungle Lodge and enjoyed it very much!!!! Ok, we like birdwatching and wildlife watching and Tikal is a great place to make a mix nature and culture. We even saw a glimpse of a tapir! We stayed in the cheap roms, with shared toilets and showerd. No problem because there were just a few other people. The food in the restaurant is OK, but the menu is the same every day. So.... don't visit Tikal on a day trip bus consider an overnight stay!!!"
20,"My wife and I stayed here for 3 nights in June 2016. Here are our Pros & Cons  Pros:  + Most staff were friendly & helpful + Located near Tikal Park + Historic lodge, with plenty of stories and photos to share. + Food was decent + Monkeys in the trees above + Big pool area for relaxing  Cons:  - The high prices for food and room doesn't reflect what you get - Pool Water was dirty - Electricity was only on for a few hours in the morning, and a few hours in the evening. (We had to use light from our cell phone to light our room after dark. - Ceiling in the bathroom was not closed off. Hundreds of winged termites came in and filled the tub, shower, sink & bathroom floor. - No bug net for the bed. We were bothered by bugs hitting out faces & mosquitoes biting us all night. One night"
40,"Pros:  + Privileged location, probably the best option in Tikal + Cheaper rooms are still comfortable + Swimming pool  + Cocktails + Howler monkeys  Cons:  - Rude and unpleasant staff - Dinner was poor - Ridiculously overpriced tours and activities, just book them somewhere else."
50,"The staff at this hotel was excellent...so friendly and helpful.  Our bungalow was clean and comfortable, and the grounds were beautiful.  We loved hearing the sounds of the animals at night and being able to wake up and walk into the jungle and learn about the history and wildlife of Tikal.  It was a great experience, and we look forward to returning to Guatemala one day...we love it!"
50,"We had a fabulous time at the Tikal Inn and will stay there again!  We spent one night there, after a week well off the beaten path in the Guatemalan Highlands.  We had the best meals of our trip at the Tikal Inn and enjoyed them immensely.  The sunrise tour is available only to those staying inside the park and is reason enough to do so.  We enjoyed the pool, which is an exceptional luxury, given that you're something like 60km inside the jungle.  Yes, the electricity gets turned off periodically, but you have to appreciate the situation you are in: deep in the jungle!  Our tour guide Jairo did a fantastic job getting us to the spot for our sunrise and then touring us around the park after.  He is very knowledgable.  If we return, we intend to have Roxy take us on an expedition"
30,"The staff at Tikal Inn are incredible, from the very accommodating gentleman named Wilver at the front desk to Henry, our excellent sunrise hike tour guide who led us through the jungle in complete darkness and kept us engaged and educated throughout the entire journey. The rooms are very spacious and the pool is a wonderful feature after working up a sweat touring the incredible Tikal National Park, which (hi, it's the jungle) gets pretty sweltering and humid in that midday sun. Those details earned the three stars. Some cons: the windows of power are not adhered to, which is incredibly frustrating when you're trying to arrange travel to the next destination. The Wifi is scarce, but I get it. We're in a national park and this hotel run on generators. Put the damn phone down."
30,"My husband and I spent two nights at Tikal Inn.    Although very basic, the rooms were clean and the beds comfortable.  The staff was all very friendly and helpful as was Roxy the manager who took some time out to give us a quick tour around the park “village” pointing out the museums, places to eat etc.  We only had one evening meal at Tikal Inn opting to try other places for lunches & dinner on our second night.  Not being very hungry, we both just had a burger but it was pretty tasty. Breakfasts were your standard options with a complimentary plate of sliced fruit whilst you waited for you cooked breakfast.  This said, the power situation at the Inn is a bit of a nightmare to say the least.  While we can completely understand that you’re in a jungle and that the generator"
30,"This hotel is actually quite nice.  It has a nice ambiance, and all the rooms are huts, which surround a pool.  It is nice for a day stay.  The tour was good as well. My complaints were easy fixes, but seemed so hard for the hotel.  For example, the menu in the restaurant is all food that is available in the US (hamburgers, pizza, french fries, nachos, etc).  Nothing authentic but the plantans.  In fact they won't give you anything else even if you ask.  Secondly they do not make concessions.  For example, they were out of nachos and anything chicken, not to mention 3 other things on the menu we asked for.  We asked for fries instead of chips, or to make chips with tortillas, but that was out of the question.  They didnt even tell us these items were not available.  We waited"
40,"We stayed at the Jaguar Dec 19 - 22 and had bedbugs in one of the beds - Cabin 3.  Other than that, the Jaguar is in a great setting, good food (slow service) and staff is helpful."
40,"Clean bungalow, with a lovely hammock outside to enjoy the jungle sounds. We'd mentioned it was our honeymoon and there was a nice touch of petals and sculpted towels on our bed.  Food was tasty, wholesome and pretty good value. Staff were friendly and helpful and their english was refreshing compared with staying in other places in Guatemala.  If you arrive to Tikal after 3pm - your park entrance is also for the next day. Great to be on site - perfect to enjoy sunsets and sunrises at the park. Also close enough to escape back to the room in the heat of the day  before venturing out again for more exploration of the fantastic ruins!  Very helpful prior to stay - good email communication and help with transportation.  Ensure you book in advance as they can get full."
30,"The grounds & the rooms are beautiful. BUT BEDBUGS ARE AN ISSUE. Not just at Jaguar Inn-but at Tikal Inn also. CHECK YOUR MATTRESS THOROUGHY--educate yourself before you travel & know what to look for & how to check your mattresses--be VIGILANT--always check the ENTIRE mattress.  We were shown a room upon arrival @ Jaguar Inn, we were allowed to check the mattress thoroughly, and in this cabana/bungalow, it was clean. I believe it was #3. We were also going to check a room at the Tikal Inn which was offered to us for much less than advertised, & $20USD less than Jaguar Inn--so we went to look at that & compare.  The room behind the office @ Tikal Inn for $40 was a no way after chacking the mattress-obvious signs of bedbugs. 20 min later we return to Jaguar Inn to take the room"
40,"I chose the Jaguar because it was the cheapest of the three hotels at Tikal, but I can't imagine being more satisfied with either of the others. The cabana style rooms are small but clean and perfectly comfortable. Electricity now runs 24 hours, and hot water was plentiful, and hot, during the specified hours. The restaurant was good. Internet access is posted as $5 per hour, but no one ever collected. Best of all, staying the night at Tikal allows access to the site before and after the tour buses appear. There's nothing quite as magical as being nearly alone in the park at dusk or sunrise. If you're coming this far, spend the night."
50,"Jaguar Inn is an excellent place to stay while visiting Tikal.  In fact, you really need a couple of days to soak in all that Tikal has to offer.  We rented a cabana for $63/night that had a king size bed and was very clean. The staff spoke English and was very helpful. The restaurant at the Jaguar Inn is good and inexpensive.  Unfortunately, it was pouring all night so we missed out on the sunrise tour of Tikal but we had heard it is amazing to watch the sunrise from Temple IV.  My partner did the zip line and loved it!  He climbed about 200 feet into the canopy with a staff in front and behind him and went on 7 different zip lines.    I highly recommend Elias Cambranes of K'atun Ahaw out of San Ignacio as a tour guide.  He has spent 20 years studying Tikal and doing tours and"
50,Jungle lodge was a fantastic choice for our stay in Tikal. The entire staff was friendly and helpful. We were upgraded to a beautiful room. Monkeys were in the trees along with toucans and parrots right outside our room.
50,"When my travel buddy and I  arrived at the Jungle Lodge after a sweaty night in Flores, we were met with a genuinely friendly smile from the receptionist, Stephanie. She offered to take us to tour the possible rooms, starting at a small low end room with communal bathroom for $35/night, then a standard room, then the junior suite and finally the suite. All rooms were nicely appointed with mosquito nets, each one slightly larger than the last. But the suite, for $110/night (discounted because of low season) included an outdoor shower and a private back porch from which to watch the abundant bird and animal life that inhabited the bit of forest surrounding it.   My friend and I then sat down to a delicious hearty breakfast and began the negotiation:  I REALLY wanted to stay in"
50,"Slept there with my boyfriend for one night, before visiting Tikal the next day. We took a standard room (one double bed without bathroom) and we were totally satisfied! Friendly and professionnal staff, comfy bed, clean bathroom... and a nice swimming pool where you can relax after a hot day in the jungle! Be prepare to hear Howler monkeys at sunrise ;)"
40,"Of the three hotels in Tikal National Park, Jungle Lodge far surpasses it's competition. Recently remodeled, the rooms are chic, updated, clean, and very comfortable. While the power for all hotels in the park are run by a generator which shuts off at night for environmental conservation purposes, the newly updated rooms provided a generous breeze throughout the night. The location also really does make a difference as the proximity to the park (literally at the park entrance) offers unparalleled opportunities to see and hear monkeys in the early mornings and around the pool! The addition of the pool and great happy hour deals are absolutely essential after a morning of traipsing through ruins. The staff is exceptionally helpful, and helped transfer our third night reservation"
40,"We stayed for 2 nights. Rooms are spacious and airy and clean. They have mosquito nets, although when we were there we did not see one mosquito. Security was not good as the windows are just opening fly wire screens without locks but the area is in the middle of the park and we felt safe. We did not check if valuables could be left at the office.  Meals were reasonably priced with good serves.  The fantastic thing is the location so you can enter the park at dawn before the crowds, and it is cooler.  You can chill by the pool during the middle of the day or sleep. Then go back for another look in the afternoon. You can buy your entrance ticket at 3 pm the day before, so in a way you get a day and a half for the same price.  One down side is that the generator only runs for about"
40,"Friendly staff, great food adapted for my vegan lifestyle, (and occasionally exotic animals curiously visiting the landscape).The dawn cacophony of the waking jungle amidst towering temples within walking distance, then relaxing in the pool after the day's explorations was memorable. I was traveling alone internationally for the first time and very much felt the staff's supportive presence throughout...from the friendly hotel van staff meeting us at the airport, to our seamless departure. The electric power went off sooner then I'd  hoped, but yielding to Tikal ' s evening enchantment was worth it! "
40,We visited Tikal National Park as a family of 2 adults and one kid. We stayed in Tikal Inn for a night. The place was best one to stay. The room was big enough and beautifully built. One get the true feeling of staying in a jungle. You could easily do your trails to varius Mayan temples from there. Even hotel people have contacts of guides for various trails. The restaurant is good too and the food was nice. They have a pool to refresh you after a tiring tour of the Mayan world.  One thing that will make you stay here is the waking up to a morning by Howler monkeys. Its an experience of a life time. Highly recommended. 
50,"'Killershay' needs an attitude and expectation adjustment. We paid total of $150 for 2 people for: transfer to/from flores, 1 night accommodation, evening meal, breakfast and early morning guided tour.  We chose additional guided sunset tour ($18pp, we where the only participants so fabulous value for money!).  So apart from a few beers it was a great place to stay.  By staying in the park itself we had constant access to enter and access Tikal at our leisure.  Phenomenal place, made all the more enjoyable by staying in the Park.  The guides, btw, where excellent. Room clean, pool refreshing and clean, food tasty and wholesome and just what you need / want after a hot sweaty hike around the ruins.  Sitting around the pool after hiking, watching tucans and listening to howler"
10,By Guatamala standards this is an expensive hotel...so yes I expected more. Of our 3 week travelling through Guatemala this hotel  we spent the most on and was the absolute worst idea and place we stayed in and had.   Firstly if youre like us and trying to decide between staying in Flores or Tikal to see the ruins...just STAY IN FLORES. You will find better hotels for a way better price.   The hotel manager who my bf was in contact with via email prior to our arrival was had told us a taxi from Flores to Tikal would be $350quetzals. When our shuttle dropped us off in flores and the shuttle company offered to get us his taxi for 350$ we declined and said Tikal Inn would be sending us one..which they did. We get to the hotel and they wanna charge us 450$...the employee at the
40,"After reading the previous reviews, I was expecting something totally different. Luckily, we had a great experience during our stay (1 night). The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful. We had some special requests and they did their best to help us out. The food was good and the waiter was awesome. The rooms (we booked 6 double rooms - group of 12) were clean and big. They turned the electricity off at nights around 10pm. We did not need the A/C since the weather was nice that night (we were extremely lucky).The swimming pool was awesome. The sunrise tour was excellent. The Wi-Fi is really slow and there is no cell phone signal.  Do not expect it to be a 5 stars hotel. It is a good hotel in the middle of the jungle. Enjoy the nature during your stay. "
10,"I came home with bed bugs.  I am very frustrated.  A few of the hotel staff were friendly, but we were greeted by grim staff upon our arrival.  Despite the fact that we contacted Edmundo ahead of time about our early morning arrival, we were not allowed to check in early."
50,"Limited ammenities but they do have internet and you are at the entrance to the park. Good, basic restaurant and several others within walking distance."
50,"This hotel is only to serve the bare minimums.  Just FYI there are only 3 actual hotels inside the part compounds.  This is the cheapest of all three.  The government will not allow for any new buildings or additions, so you will stay in the same comfort from 30+ years others have enjoyed.  The heat around this time of the year is unbearable, i live in florida and the heat in Tikal is worse!! The power is provided by a generator from the park so the lights will be out at 10:00 pm but for us they were still running at 1100 pm.  Internet is 5 extra dollars for WIFI, and the breakfast was offered to us for 5 us dollars, we wanted to see the sunrise and they gladly bagged for us a sandwich, bottle of water, a juice, a banana and some crackers in the bag for us to eat.  This way, you"
40,"I stayed here with my husband for only one night, but the location can't be beat.  Rooms are basic but we were able to go to Tikal at sunset and sunrise the next morning.  We slept wonderfully, enjoyed our meals in the restaurant and relaxed on our bungalow patio hammock.  All in all we were very pleased with our selection."
30,"we stayed here for 2 nights, we pulled in late the first night, spent the next day at tikal, and then spent another night. this hotel is cute, it's in the jungle right beside tikal so perfect location. the rooms were just ok, pretty basic, no frills for sure, could have used a little updating. but we got a great price for staying so close to tikal. next time i would only spend one night and head out to Flores, which was a great town. Be warned they charge 5% every time you use your credit card, which is a real pain, so make sure you bring cash if you don't want to pay that. they also don't run a 'hotel tab' so you can't pay all at once at the end. the other two hotels there were nicer but also more money. Food in restaurant was okay, nothing special, breakfast was good. internet"
40,"Nearly before the entrance of the Tikal park you go right to Jungle Lodge. They have bungalows, but also hostel rooms with , as we had, seperate beds. The Hostel rooms have shared bathrooms and toilets for man and women. These are clean. A great plus is the nice swimming pool. We went early in the morning to the park and were back around 10.30 just before the heat. We didn't use the restaurant. Near the entrance you can find a few good commodores for food and drinks. Wifi was available in the reception area. The people at reception are , we found, not very friendly and helpful."
40,For a lodge in the jungle the rooms were far better than we had anticipated. The clean rooms were large with a big comfortable bed with a mosquito net and a couple of chairs and a table. The bathroom not only had a large shower but also a bath. There are no hairdryers in the room but reception had one I could borrow. There is a seating area under cover outside each little lodge. The lodges have no air conditioning but they do have ceiling fans. However the electricity is only turned on for three periods a day and goes off in the evening around 10 so there is no fan working overnight! So it is a good idea to take a small torch with you. There is a great pool which is perfect for cooling off and enjoying a cocktail during 'Happy Hour'. We were woken in the morning (5.30 am one day
40,"Here's the deal on this place coming from someone who has traveled through most of central and South America ... And has stayed in budget hostels for $5/night to some nicer high end boutiques.   Pros: -location! It's at the start of the entry way to Tikal and you seriously can't get any closer to the park -the pool with happy hour 2 for 1 drinks and where you can watch monkeys play on trees -splurge if you can and get the suite with the mountain view-- it's more of a jungle view but amazing! There's an outdoor rain shower with patio chairs to rest on, an indoor shower and tub. It's soooo hot and humid that even for a hot shower lover for myself- the tepid waters were more than fine.  -they allowed us early check in at 8am which I was super grateful for.   Cons:  -lunch and"
40,"Although it is a bit expensive, it is the nicest place in Tikal. But know that electricity can go off at any time, even in the middle of the day. It has a nice pool which is where you want to be early in the afternoon because of the extreme heat. They were featuring 2 for the price of 1 mojitos at the pool from 1-5 while we were there. There was a visiting family of spider monkeys in the trees. We visited the ruins in the morning & late afternoon. You may also want to take a siesta in the early afternoon as its likely that howler monkeys will wake you up at least once during the night. "
50,This Hotel was perfect for our time in the Jungle. We felt cozy and relaxed after day trips in the jungle. The rooms are very nice and clean. The restaurant was delicious all  the meals we had were amazing. The staff was very helpful and friendly. Our server Alex was very delightful. He gave us great pointers and tips for our stay. He went above and beyond his role as a server. The pool area was a real nice treat after hiking all day.   As you see in other reviews people have commented on mosquito's and monkey's it's expected to have to deal with these elements when in the jungle. If you are not ready for this type of experience than just stay home. This hotel does a great job considering the location and the natural elements around it.
40,"One of two hotels by the entrance of the Tikal national park. Delightful grounds, swimming pool (where we were surrounded by dragon flies in the day and fireflies in the evening) and a very decent restaurant. The rooms are airy with large bathroom areas, and very good insect screens on all the windows. That's not to say insects don't get in, but the odd gecko or spider is to be expected given it is situated in the forest.   The electricity goes off around 9 or 10pm but there is a fairly bright long-life recharged light above the beds that has enough power to stay on all night, if you have small children who like a night light.  One Lunchtime pasta dish is really enough for two people in the heat.   The far end of the lawn in front of the two storey block has those amazing leaves"
50,"You really can't beat staying inside the national park, and with two little boys, the pool was critical.  I thought the food was fine; you just have to keep in mind that you're in the boonies, so don't expect that they'll have everything on the menu.  The staff was very nice, the rooms were fine, and I LOVED hearing the howler monkeys at night.  I also must have spent two hours watchign the big group of spider monkeys that were playing around just in the back of the hotel.  BTW:  we were in the room/bungalow closest to the kitchen, but we experienced no issues with noise (it didn't start until about 6:30 AM, and by then we were awake anyway)."
50,"We stayed for 2 nights at the Tikal Inn on August 13th and 14th. We had requested a bungalow facing the jungle and received it. We arrived about 10:30 am on the 13th. We knew our room wouldn't be ready but it was not a problem because we wanted to get over to the park, due to a misunderstanding of park fees on my part. We came back later in the day and were shown to our room. Even though it had been warm in the park the room felt cool as the ceilings had about a 1 foot screened opening that cooled the room. We had no issue w/the electricity being turned off. Our room came w/dinner and breakfast. Basic but filling. Roxie was everywhere and was very friendly; willing to share her knowledge of Tikal. We loved the sounds of the howler monkeys in the early morning. If you walk out"
40,"My rating is very good for the type of hotel this is: a few steps above basic: some separate bungalows by a nice pool, simple restaurant with good local food and they accommodate gluten-free diets well.  The electricity only runs twice a day for a few hours in the rooms and longer in the restaurant.  It is clean and comfortable with covered outdoor seating and screens on all windows. Shower in the daytime or when the electricity is on.  A flashlight/headlamp is a MUST! They do have a low voltage nightlight that works when the power is off. No shampoo for some reason... Be forewarned: the sound of the howler monkeys in the morning (4:50 for 15 minutes) is right out of a horror movie unless you know what to expect. Free sunrise nature walk that other people raved about. Friendly"
40,"This attraction of this hotel lies in its location and the feeling of living in the jungle. Most visitors come for only one night, but we were happy to have decided to stay for two nights, so we could relax by the pool, enjoy the garden and the many visiting wild animals from the jungle: coatis (pistes), jungle turkeys, the Guatemalan ""caviar"", beautiful species of birds etc.  The handling of reservations is a bit disorganized and caused us many headaches but it all worked out fine. The food was fine and it was good that it was included in the cost of the room so we didn't have to worry about where to eat.  The staff was friendly and relaxed and made us feel comfortable at all times.  The guide to the Tikal (also included) gave us an amazing sunrise tour of Tikal. No visible"
40,"My friend and I stayed here Feb 10 because we wanted to be inside the park. We paid $60 for a private double room with private bathroom. The hotel's pretty expensive, but I heard it was the cheapest among the three hotels inside Tikal. There was no free breakfast, which means you need to order your meals either with them or at the restaurants that are located near the entrance of the park. The food in Jaguar is phenomenal. We ordered the Piramides for breakfast and it was scrumptious. There was also no free Wi-Fi ($5 for password), but we welcomed that since we were in the jungle anyway. The big plus here was the location. You can only view the sunrise or sunset IF you stay inside the park, and for us, the highlight of the Tikal trip was the sunrise. It was simply stunning. A"
40,"My wife and I spent 2 nights here on our trip to Guatemala in Feb. 2010.   We had asked the Jaguar Inn to arrange transportation for us from Flores Airport.  No one showed up to pick us up, but no worries, there are lots of taxis available - just make sure you negotiate a firm price beforehand.  Actually, it turned out to be a lot cheaper to arrange our own transportation that let them do it for us.  Once we arrived at the Jaguar Inn, we were well treated.  The hotel/restaurant staff seemed to operate in ""slow motion"" with regard to service (don't be in a hurry to get your bill), but they were friendly enough.  Also, the food at the hotel restaurant is excellent - I had some of my best meals in Guatemala here.  The rooms are very basic, comfortable and clean.  They did clearly"
40,"As you know, the main reason to stay in Tikal is to get an early start at the archeological site.  That being said, we chose the Jaguar Inn for our overnight stay based on travel books and the reviews you are now reading.  We booked directly through their website, which was cumbersome but effective.  The staff were helpful and courteous (DISCLAIMER:  We are native Spanish speakers).  The rooms were basic, but more than adequate.  During our visit, electricity was available 24 hours a day in the room, but we think the parkside village lights go out at 9 pm.  Hot water was available for 6 hours a day (6 to 9 am and 6 to 9 pm).  We had read complaints of jungle noise being a problem at night, but didn't really have any issues (probably too tired to notice!!).  We ate an excellent"
50,"Out of all the fancy hotels in Flores and Tikal National Park my friends and I decided to choose Jaguar Inn. For a great value we got to stay at a hotel situated within walking distance of the Tikal National Park. When we arrived at the hotel we were surprised to see that the main lobby/desk had a thatch roof. They also used plants from the jungle to decorate the walkways leading to the bungalows, it added a very natural atmosphere that helped it blend in into the surrounding jungle.The hotel itself was very eco-friendly with bathrooms that used a natural chemical process to break down waste. The staff was very nice and friendly and helped us with everything that we needed. We booked a room with two beds, they were nice enough to give us a room with three beds. The room was very"
40,"We loved staying at Jaguar Inn.  Originally had 3 nights but changed to 2.  Purely as we had done everything we had planned to do.   The staff were wonderful, very attentive, food was great.    Room was really nice - King room near restaurant. The power went off heaps but it didnt matter.  THe whole ambience of the Mayan ruins and just where you are is great.  We would highly recommend.  Great Margaritas."
40,"Stayed in a junior suite which was clean, spacious and comfortable - better than we had expected.  The bathroom was amazing, but its almost worse to give you such a fabulous bathroom when the ""hot"" water is never more than slightly lukewarm.  The staff are very helpful.  Food in the restaurant is generally okay, although as most people don't stay for more than one or two nights, it is not at all varied.  Breakfast is buffet style - it is quite expensive, but if you eat plenty then you can spend the whole day in the park and not worry about lunch!  The location is fantastic and there is plenty of wildlife around, birds, monkeys, agouti.  The howler monkeys were in the trees outside the cabin, and were pretty noisy at night - but that's the kind of thing that is a bonus in our"
50,"Jungle Lodge is best location for Visiting Tikal. The staff couldn't be nicer. So helpful. The rooms are magnificent. Ours had the most amazing bathroom and outdoor shower. Bathtub had huge windows with views of the jungle. Patio was lovely. We just sat there watching monkeys swing through trees. Pool is beautiful  Only downside is dinner. Food is heavy and nothing particularly Central American, its fake continental.  Breakfast is great. We ate dinner one night in the market area was great and much cheaper.  Take the sunrise tour. Hotel will arrange  Remember its the jungle. Internet is at lobby and pool and slow. Power is not on all the time.  If you cant disconnect and enjoy jungle, anywhere in Tikal is not for you."
40,Staying in the park gives you the opportunity to do sunset in the site which was incredible. We went back in the park after lunch and in the afternoon and evening we were practically by ourselves. Sunset was also magical. You also have the benefit of going into the temple early and sunset if you fancy it.  We had low expectations of this hotel because of the reviews but the breakfast and dinner were good and the room was large and comfortable. Electricity turns off at 10pm so be ready for that! Make sure you do not use the hotel for any transport of tours as they are expensive. We arranged our transport when we were in Flores (transport only return was $20 each) and we got our guide at the park information center and he was GREAT!
40,"We stayed in a junior suite that looks more like a cabin. Clean and modern, it  is either new or recently renovated. The howler monkeys put on an impressive show. The bad thing was we were eaten alive by bugs overnight. We used the mosquito netting provided but when we woke up in the morning, any body part that was not covered was covered in bites. We didn't feel anything nor did we ever see a bug."
40,"We spent one night at the Tikal Jungle Lodge, recently.  I found it totally acceptable (particularly in the context of the jungle location in a poor country). The pool and grounds were beautiful, the staff was friendly, and the room was fine. Two items, however, to note: the restaurant food is mediocre at best (suggest they consider serving Guatemalan food rather than bland international cuisine), and your room may become stifling hot between 10 pm and 6 am when the electricity (and your ceiling fan) turns off."
40,"We stayed here for 1 night as we were doing the sunrise tour of Tikal. The location is obviously fantastic with being a short walk to the ruins.  The room itself was big, we had 2 double beds in ours and the bathroom was functional. There is a lights out policy here so late at night and early morning you will have no electricity. My only dislike of this place was the ticker tape they placed in our room as decoration. Our bed was covered with it and it got in and on everything. 5 weeks later once I got home, I was still finding pieces of shredded paper! Very annoying and not needed (I hope they take note).  We had dinner in their restaurant as well and this was very basic food... there really isn't any other option though.  We made good use of the pool. It was nice to relax after"
40,"Other reviewers seem to have relished the jungle ambiance and enjoyed spending 2-3 days at this hotel. But we also found it to be an excellent choice for our goal of making our 24 hours in Tikal the most pleasant and efficient as possible.  We arrived in the evening and had dinner in their spacious dining room, where a number of tables accommodate large groups or combined parties. Keep in mind when choosing your food that they are not able to use much by way of refrigeration, owing to the electrical power situation.  Their electricity, like all of the locations in the national park, comes from a generator. Thus it runs only 3-4 hours in the late morning, and 3-4 hours in the evening. Make sure to bring a flashlight or headlamp, although they have installed battery-operated LED"
40,"This is not a luxury hotel by any means, but you are there to see Tikal and the location couldn't be better.  Electricity is only on for a few hours a day, so no lights  / charging / wifi during that time.  Food is actually pretty good considering.  Pool is very nice.  The sunrise tour is a must - you set off at 4am (you get up in the dark because there is no electricity) and set off to the sound of the howler monkeys. My tips would be, take proper walking shoes - the site is quite big and when it rains roughy and muddy underfoot, and most importantly, take a good torch (one each)."
40,"The Hotel itself is mediocre; the appeal is the location.   The hotel is located inside of Tikal National Park.  This enables easy access and a place to rest between tours of the ruins.  The electricity is only on for a couple of hours per day, so the ceiling fans don't operate most of the time.  This makes sleeping a bit miserable.    On the upside the Hotel has a nice pool which is great for cooling off."
50,"When you come to Tikal, you are in the middle of of the Peten jungle surrounded by the incredible ruins and amazing wildlife. You should not be expecting to stay at and have all of the amenities of a luxury hotel. Hopefully, you have done a little homework and realize some of the limitations that a hotel in the jungle has  WIth that said, the Tikal Inn is a great place to stay. This was my second time to stay at the Tikal Inn with my first time being a year ago. The biggest difference that I noticed between my two visits is the friendliness and helpfulness of Roxy and her staff. Roxy began managing the Tikal Inn earlier this year. She is a very friendly and helpful host. She speaks English well. She frequently checked to make sure our meals were good, the tours went well, our"
40,"Yes the rooms are pretty basic and the electricity did go off for us at about 11pm but that was  the beauty of it, simple lodging similar to the country you are in. If you want the Ritz go elsehwere but it was great for us. As others mentioned the best way to see the part is to arrive late in the afternoon, throw your bags in the room and get in the park by 4pm. We had the park to ourselves until closing, well except for the howler monekys and  we were escorted out by the shot-gun armed security team at dusk, way cool. Dont forget to bring flashlights, you never know when you will need them. We found a great trail of leaf-cutter ants after leaving the bar at the more expensive hotel in pitch darkness since there isnt much lighting anywhere after 11pm. Tikal is unbelievable"
40,"I just got back from our trip to Belize and Guatemala. We only stayed at the Jaguar Inn for one  night. We slept in the quadruple room; there were four of us. There was one double bed and three triple beds. So looking back on it, we could have slept at least 5 people in the room and more if people would be willing to squeeze two to a double  bed. The room had plenty of room for suitcase and a clean bathroom and shower. The hot water only works during certain periods during the day, but after walking around the ruins all day, a cold shower was just what the doctor ordered! The grounds of the hotel are very well manicured and landscaped. The hotel runs off of solar powered batteries after 9pm. But you can run a celing fan all night and sleep with the windows open. It was"
20,"Stayed here 2 nights in August 2009.  It was the only bad hotel of the four I stayed in during my trip to Guatemala and Belize.  As with the other reviewers, I found service pretty surly, I didn't even use the shower in the bathroom as it was quite unpleasant and the beds weren't comfortable.  It's only US$40 a night so it's hard to complain too much and it's certainly better to rough it there in order to be onsite for an early morning and late afternoon visit to Tikal, but it's a shame there isn't a slightly more upmarket option.  I would recommend staying there ONLY because of its location.  Food wasn't great either, but then, you are quite a way from anywhere.  Tip: although if you wait til 4pm you get a ticket that allows entry for that afternoon and the next day, I paid the"
30,"I stayed here for one night, because I wanted to stay in the park and couldn't afford the other hotels.  Our room was large and clean, with a fairly comfy king-sized bed.  While it wasn't luxurious, I was very happy with my choice to stay in the park itself--that way, you can come home and shower and nap over lunch, and you're not stuck with the hour-long ride to El Ramate or Flores after a long day of sightseeing.  I thought the food in the hotel restrurant was poor--try Comedor Tikal instead.  Also, some people report losing their reservation, so I'd recommend pre-paying in full, printing out your receipt, and emailing to confirm a few days before.  We had no problems.  Finally, if you want to take a cheap ""collectivo"" van back to Flores, ask at the tourist information at the"
20,"Staff was average, did not go out of their way to help at all.  We tried to speak to the manager several times but he was only around at sporadic hours.  Exchange rate at the hotel is a total rip-off.  They charged us USD 60 for an airport pickup from Flores, when you can get a private taxi for USD 30.  Do not recommend using them for transport or tours.  Rooms are sub-par: bed is not very comfortable, sheets and towels decent but not crazy clean, room is spacious, that's about it.  Power goes off at 9 pm, so there is no fan or way to keep cool at all.  It gets insanely warm at night, we couldn't sleep at all.  The hotel is packed with day tourists, they use it as a base for touring the ruins.  We did not try the food, since everything seemed overpriced for the area.  We ate at"
20,"yes, this hotel is ta the entrance of the park but they didn't take advantage of the location and the hotel is sad and dark. Furthermore they didn't transfer our reservation at booking when we arrived and booking asked for fees. And to finish, they charged us more than 23 dollars for a transportation for semuc champey when all the others hotels charged no more than 15.  Disappointed..."
40,"I found the facilities to be better than expected: very nice pool and surroundings, the restaurant was also very well kept, and the rooms were good.  The bedding is comfortable.  And of course, the location, inside the Tikal Park, can't be better if you want to explore this amazing park.  The service at the restaurant is very good.  People need to understand that this is inside a National Park in a rural and remote location, so the availability of electricity and hot water is totatlly understandable, and even part of the charm!  I think overall it was a very positive experience.   I think the staff can make an effort to deliver the rooms as they are ready, and not to enforce the check-in time so stricktly: they delivered all the rooms at 2:50pm (check in at 3), and of course"
40,Although we specificallyvisited Tikal to see the ruins the high lights for me were the early morning and evening walks where the birdlife was excellent.  The lodge itself was clean and the rooms adequate.  The dining facilities were good and the food excellent
30,"Jungle Lodge is a beautiful hotel, with a very nice swimming pool in a deck facing the jungle! Beautiful! It's location is amazing, right inside the Tikal Park! Very green!! But there is basically nothing around it, just the park itself, some souvenir tends and about 2 or 3 restaurants near the park entrance.   THE STAFF in this hotel was not very friendly. Not welcoming.  We went to the hotel restaurant just to check on the menu, and the waiter came and offered us a shuttle to Flores!  Please note that this is very common. And annoying!! Some of them will keep offering you a very expensive transfer to Flores. (At least it happened to us!!) We wanted to know about the menu, and he came offering a transfer to Flores. The worst thing is, they do that because THEY WANT TO MAKE"
50,"This is a great property given that you are in the jungle of Guatemala!!  The bungalows were small, very clean, very adequate, with the features that you need with one exception.  The beds had mosquito netting on them for protection from the bugs.  The shower was excellent with lots of hot water.  The bed was comfortable, but only in a regular size.  The surprise was that there is only power generated from 6 to 8 in the morning and in the evening they shut off the generators around 10PM.  Other times there was not power.  Of course you should be out in the jungle viewing the Tikal ruins at that time anyways.  Don't plan on Internet except in the reception area/office which has power for most of the day (to accept your credit cards of course!).  And cell phone service is not"
30,"This place is a mix of emotions. Nicely located. Very nicely located, even. The trees and flowers are gorgeous. You get to see spider monkeys at the end of the afternoon playing around on the surrounding trees. Birds, bees and a lot of fire flies (beautiful) after the lights go out at 10pm and the stars offers you one of the best natural scenarios you'll see in a while, believe me. The bungalows are good. Clean. If you can, choose one by the pool, which is ok, too. Our bungalow wasn't ready by check-in time (which is 2pm). We were given the bungalow keys by the check-in time and had to wait for the very nice lady who was doing the room to finish the cleaning. She apologized but it wasn't her fault, really. It was the front desk guy who looked like a fox (you'll recognize him)"
50,"At the beginning of July 2014, I lead a tour group  from Belize City  to Tikal, where of course  whilst there, i had to use a guide from their neck of the woods  to conduct the  tours for me.  Couple months prior to my arrival, I was doing some research on  Tikal Inn and Tikal Lodge. I emailed both places but choose Tikal Inn for this trip.   The room I stayed in was comfortable, nice and clean with screens on the windows. The Staff were very courteous and helpful.  However, the Receptionist that took good care of us is not the same person I was communicating with from the beginning, for the person who i was communicating with is apparently in Guatemala city. I wish I had the Hotels direct contact then, caz i had so many questions for them before I got there. and they either"
50,"Loved it here - such a special place to stay and so glad we stayed in the park. We stayed in a big room by the swimming pool. Loved sitting there at night and watching the fireflies. Swimming pool was lush! Rooms are big but nothing special but you aren't here for the hotel room! Food was good and tasty. Staff we are excellent. Amazing variety of birds and animals in the gardens of the hotel. So thrilled to see hummingbirds and toucans as we sat by the pool.   Roxy took real time to give us excellent advice on wildlife and the ruins. We LOVED the sunrise tour. Given by an archeologist, sorry can't remember his name, incredibly informative and fascinating. Tikal itself was one of the most amazing places I have ever been. Please stay in the park to experience the quiet evening and"
20,"I read all of the reviews before booking the Tikal Inn for one night so my expectations weren't very high.  I booked the package for a junior quad pool suite with dinner, breakfast, and complementary sunrise tour for $208.  It wasn't easy communicating by email so I finally called the hotel to make sure my reservation was confirmed.  I used Antigua Tours to arrange transportation throughout our trip and asked them to organize private transfer to and from the Tikal Inn.  It seems they just subbed it out to Tikal Inn as the vouchers I received had the name of Tikal Inn for transport.  There should have been a driver with a sign with our name on arrival at the airport.  No one was there but there was a driver with a sign for Tikal Inn so I spoke with him and after some time just"
40,"We stayed for one night - the reason that you stay in this place is for the proximity to the park and the fact you can then do the sunrise or sunset tour. It isn't because you want fantastic accommodation or food. Our overall feelings reflect this as the actual hotel is average at best due to the lack of competition but experience as a whole (particularly the sunrise tour) made it worth it.   Accommodation wise, we took a hotel room which was $US 100 for a one night package. On arrival we were told paying by credit card was a 7% fee which differs to the information provided to you in advance. It was a very basic room but it was clean and did the job. Dinner and breakfast is included in the package. Dinner was a bit of a disaster as we waited an hour, which is a long time given"
50,"I can't say much about the rooms, as I stayed in one of the Jaguar Inn hammocks for about 5 USD.  The experience was definitely worth the price, but I would never do it again, as it turned out to be terribly uncomfortable.  What I do want to is acknowledge how great the staff was.  They were friendly while I was there, but more importantly, they were extremely helpful after I left my diary behind.  I left it outside on a table where it was subsequently soaked by rain, but when I contacted the staff via email, they were kind enough to package it and send it to me in the USA, WITHOUT me having to pay for shipping.  (I later reimbursed them via paypal anyway.)  If I ever return to Tikal, it will definitely be at Jaguar Inn (though probably not the hammock this time.)  I highly"
50,"We were pleasantly surprised by the room and the Inn after a hard day of travel from Belize to Tikal.  The room was really nice and big with a beautiful bathroom.  It is located in the jungle and there is a hemmock next each room.  The restaurant is really good and reasonably priced.   After we checked in and pull out ourselves together, we were are to enter the park and see the sunset in the Park.  Some tips: if you are going on the sunrise tour, make sure you have a flash light, it will be pitch dark when you get up in the morning around the hotel.  Since the check out is 12:00, you can come back from the Tikal around 10AM (when it is really hot) and take a shower and nap before check out.  Oh yeah, the internet is really over priced at the Inn."
40,"I would recommend getting money exchanged in Flores prior to arriving in Tikal.  There's only a few lodgings in Tikal National Park.  These places have horrible exchange rates and a monopoly on your money if you run out of Quezales.   The rooms were pretty standard, don't expect a 5-star experience; the beds were more like cots and we stuffed our group (7 people) into one room since that was all they had.    While we were there the electricity went out at 9pm and resumed around 6am, that seems to be the norm as there was a notice posted in our room regarding electricity.  There was no AC so you can imagine what 7 people stuffed in a hot room might feel like.  We thought it was completely bearable but someone who is used to living in comfort and style while traveling should take"
50,"went there last sept. ok, this is no 5 star resort but at 55$ a night you cant beat it if you wanna be in the center of the greatest mayan city ever discovered. no electricity no phones and no internet but so what? you came here for tikal not to stay inside the hotel! they treated us great!!! the breakfast was great! queso fresco w/black beans and tortillas,yummy. and the ruins were well, you know, out of this world!! if you go after 3pm yo can visit for free the next day. also do watch the sunset it is beathtaking to be overlokking the jungle canopy and seeing the skycrapers of tikal rise up.

50,"I would recomend this hotel and plan to go back again someday! The staff was very helpful and friendly, also spoke good english. The room and bathroom were both a good size and pretty clean. Our room had 3 twin beds and a desk. The location in the park was great also! The leave you a large bottle of water, candles and matches in the room since the power is turned off at night which was helpful. If you are going to tikal staying in the park is great, the sounds of the jungle at night were amazing! We were able to walk all over the park easily from our room. I would say its quiet there other than the animals at night but it was worth a little noise to hear the animals!"
50,"I have to admit this review is long in coming but has nonetheless been in our hearts and minds since. We were doing a one day Tikal tour and decided to check out this hotel before we left in the evening.To our surprise,many of the staff were on their way to a full moon tour of the major pyramids at that same time.Ricardo and some of his guys invited us along with our 2 year old son and off we went.It was needless to say an amazing experience and beautiful walk among the bats and chirping critters.After returning,Ricardo invited us to stay at the hotel due to the lateness of the drive back to Flores at that hour.He could not have been more sincere and considerate of us and we enjoyed the hotel immensely.The pool really is a focal point and considering the high temperatures during"
40,"WE stayed here for 3 nights, the temples were amazing so could overlook anything else.  I am not young but with he help of others got pulled up or crawled on hands and knees to get to the top of the temples, just tremendous, you cannot believe these ruins! Sunset tour was very good but not so enamoured of the sunrise one, best thing was walking through the jungle and hearing the howler monkeys howl in the pitch black!  The hotel was good, fairly basic but shower was Ok and the bed was large and comfy, food not too great but again Ok and it was nice to cool off in the pool.  Our transfers were good, bit surprised to have to pay park entry on the way to the hotel but it all worked out well.  So Glad we saw this and like I say the hotel was good, staff very nice and food/drinks"
30,"Pros: Great tour guide for sunrise tour Excellent location to access Tikal easily by foot Very friendly front desk and restaurant staff Reasonable food and prices (don't expect too much in the location) Bungalows were a good size Wasn't too busy, was given a late checkout  Cons: Bathroom quite dated No electricity to charge items in rooms during the day Water turned off during night  Electricity on 10am-3pm, then 6pm to 10 pm, but that doesn't mean you can charge items in your room ( bring spare batteries to be sure) Major negative was that one was promised certain transfers at certain cost. Management then adamantly disputed this, despite producing email confirmations, blaming the booking operator, however note that the email came from the brother of the pair of siblings who"
30,"I stayed at Tikal Inn in early May with my husband.  We requested a jungle side bungalow and were given B11, which was pretty much what we expected as far as the setup.  The room was clean and equipped with an emergency light for when the electricity goes out.  However, the bathroom had no wash clothes and the two bath towels were like sandpaper as they must have been line dried.  We are pretty low maintenance travelers, but having decent (not plush) linens shouldn't be that difficult.  I made the arrangements for our stay and they really failed in that area.  Luckily they had our reservation on the books when we got there, but it took many emails to get things set up.  Over the course of our communications, I had to deal with several people who didn't seem to know what the"
40,"If you are in Guatemala to see Tikal, stay close to the park and stay at Tikal Inn.  Did the Sunset and Sunrise tours and it was nice to be right next to the park.  The Tikal Inn isn't anything exceptional but they are one of the few games in town.  Food was average to good (dinner and breakfast came with reservation).  Regret not using it but the pool did look tempting.  Tip:  When setting up a shuttle through Tikal Inn, they use Maya Heartland.  I was initially quoted $35 to San Ignacio and $60 to Belize city per person (and later quoted $90pp to Belmopan???).  I set up two people to San Ignacio.  Three days before my arrival, Maya Heartland emailed and said we would have to pay $50 per person.  I tried to reason with them and even sent them the orginal quote I had received"

It was great to be woken by the howler monkeys and to see all the wildlife going around the trees within the grounds of the lodge.  It was also an advantage to be able to come and go to the ruins from the lodge throughout the day and evening.  Thus we could relax by the pool at the hottest part of the day and avoid a lot of the crowds.  Our room/cabin was one that had been renovated recently and so was well furnished.  A lovely bathroom and 2 double beds plus plenty of space around the room.  What seemed odd was that we had a bath but hot water was very limited and just enough for 2 people to shower.  The lodge also only provided 1 small bottle of drinking water, despite the water in"
40,"The location can't be beat.  My room was very clean and comfortable.  Very gracious and comfortable public areas.  There is a good, attached restaurant that serves breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  Screens on the windows in addition to mosquito nets on the beds.  Friendly, helpful service.  Negatives: no wifi (I don't think there is wifi anywhere in the park), no cellular telephone service, electricity only 7 hours per day."
30,"I regret staying there and I found it expensive, not good value for money. Some of the staff were friendly. The room are clean with hot shower but a  total lack of charm. I wish I had stay in El Remate (1/2h drive from Tikal) as it is by the lake, away from the crowed and the scenery is beautiful. I didn't enjoy my dinner either. I had an eggplant salad for starter and it was quite oily. "
40,"We stayed in a hostel room at the Jungle Lodge and found it a great experience.  We paid just $54 for thel room which was a private room with 2 twin beds and the bathrooms were just down the way.  It was all clean and nice.  Very good for a hotel in the jungle in a Central American country.  There was a restaurant with tasty food, though we expected something a little more Guatemalan on the menu.  The electricity is on from 6 AM to 10 PM, so don't plan to charge your devices at night!  The wifi is just as people have noted:  we could always connect but could not often get anywhere.  But we were mostly there to see the jungle, we can surf at home.  The hotel staff were all very nice.  Seemed like they could be a little more knowledgeable about the park.  It may be, though, that"
50,"i stayed in the ""hostel"" bit with the shared bathroom...I don't think there are dorms...by ""hostel"" I had a private room including towels, soap and shampoo. it was basic but spotless. Same with the shared bathrooms...completely spotless showers and toilets. The food is crazy expensive so if the sun is still up ( or reso still open) ...have a meal at the much cheaper visitor centre or bring/buy LOTS of your own grub (definitely bring your own booze!)   I have to say that it is a bit expensive but the experience is one of a kind; you don't wake up to howler monkeys everyday.    Electricty will go out at 10pm and restart at about 7am so make sure all batteries are charged before going to bed.    The on site pool is a great spot to relax if there construction going on..and happy"
30,"We really wanted to spend two days in the park and be able to get up early and head in, without taking the hour-long drive from Flores/Santa Elena, so we knew we were going to have to shell out a bit more than we normally would to stay at one of the hotels in the park. The setting of Jaguar Inn is really quite lovely; we saw lots of interesting, exotic birds just sitting outside of our room. The room itself really could be quite nice, but was in great need of new paint on the walls and some detail-oriented cleaning. All things considered, the room could look radically different for the equivalent of about 5-10 US dollars. The fact that those simple changes haven't been attended to says a little something about the place. I think that the location causes them to rest on their"
50,"We stayed three nights at Jaguar Inn.  It was well worth it to stay inside the Park and get a real feel for the place.  We spent one afternoon and one entire day exploring Tikal - what a mind blowing experience!  We also did the Canopy Tour which was a lot of fun.  There's a nice jungle walk too, but be sure to protect yourself from the mosquitos."
50,"The cheapest in-park hotel. It had lots of charm. Most rooms are duplex bungalows with hammocks hanging out front. Electricity and hot water are limited to certain hours of the day. The restaurant is good and the staff are helpful. We loved staying here for early/late park access. We awakened each morning to the sounds of birds and monkeys. On the grounds were monkeys, toucans, parrots and many other birds."
30,We stayed at the Jaguar Inn purely for it's location in the Tikal National Park as we wanted to do the sunrise tour.  We paid $60 for a double bed with private bathroom.  You are purely paying for location and the priviledge of staying in the park.  The accommodation itself is very basic and tired.  Be aware they don't have power 24/7 and charge for the use of wifi.  Also the reception staff did not tell us when we booked the sunrise tour that it did not include park entry fee.
20,"Stayed at the Jaguar Inn as the location is great. But the receptionist is something else... he is so RUDE!!! I wanted to see the room before paying for it, and he denied to show it to me, he wanted the money first! Also the food is not that great and the service very slow... Shame, the hotel could be a great place to stay if they would kick out some of the staff!!"
30,"TIKAL  INN…Guatemala, May 05 to May 07  When coming from Belize you will have to pay a departure fee of 37.50 Belize Dollars ($18.75 US per person)  and also a US $3.50 entrance fee per person into Guatemala at the their border.  Also, when entering the ""Parque Nacional Tikal"" you will have to pay 150.00 Quetzales per person (only local currency is accepted), therefore be sure to change MONEY at the border in Guatemala, otherwise the guards will NOT let you into the park, no US Dollar is accepted here. We arrived at the Tikal Inn, were greeted at the desk by Willver and Melvin…. be aware these two guys run HOT & COLD with your requests. We were accommodated in room B-12 facing the garden. The room itself needs some maintenance (see pictures) it was clean, but if you look around"
50,"We think Tikal Inn is great. Really good service - we got to Santa Elena late after taking a bus from Belize, hadn't booked a transfer, called Tikal Inn and Ricardo picked us up and provided a transfer within 5 minutes. The people are friendly, the food is decent, the room good and the sunrise tour guide was fantastic. We really recommend the sunset tour as you have the place to yourself and it's magical. Tikal Inn exceeded our expectations and was good value."
40,"We booked the stay, breakfast, dinner, and sunrise tour package. It was perfect. Our room was just off the main lobby. It was clean, spacious, and screened. We didn't have any issues with noise and loved our guide. Don't expect luxury but Tikal Inn was a pleasant stay in the middle of the jungle.   As others have mentioned... Explore the park in the late afternoon sans guide and then do the guided sunrise tour through the hotel the next morning. If u buy your ticket after 3:30 it is valid the following day. "
50,"Hotel Tikal Inn was fabulous. The pool made it totally worth it. We did the jungle sunrise tour, and it was great to avoid the heat... but we definitely needed a mid day nap. It was too hot for anything else anyway... except a refreshing dip in the pool. By afternoon we were ready to go back out, and that is when we saw the monkeys and most of the wild life. Glad we were staying in the park for that reason! The people that worked at the hotel were extremely helpful, let me practice my spanish, but when I lacked, they spoke perfect English. The bungalows were great. The El Rancon place looked good too... it's not as far as it seems from the website. Everything is really close. No holes in the screens. Keep the windows open at night, so you get the breeze. The first night we were"
50,"In a very nice location with comfortable rooms. A great pool for a cool afternoon swim. Friendly and helpful staff. Good food and drink. Monkeys, insects and birds.  What more could you want so far out in the jungle?"
20,"Two years ago my husband and I stayed at The Jungle Lodge in Tikal and loved everything about it. When we tried to book a room this year The Jungle Lodge quoted us an outrageous price, so we turned to the Jaguar Inn based on TripAdvisor reviews we found now and before. I guess you really do get what you pay for. The Jaguar was mediocre on every level, except that the waiters were very nice and the staff were generally pleasant and helpful. Our room was large, but not very clean. The pillows were lumpy and the sheets were covered in pills. Added to the unavoidable sodden feeling of being in the jungle, the bedding just made my skin crawl. The bathroom looked like a science experiment in growing mildew. I understand that humidity causes mildew, but this was nasty; mildew was on"
20,"A friend and I had booked a stay at the Jaguar Inn for two nights.  We really liked how close the hotel was to Tikal, but had a bad experience with receptionist, who was rude and condesending to us.  We were told our room would be ready at 2, which it was not.  Also, the man was very rude to us and when we told him we wanted two beds, like the emails had stated and had been confirmed by him, he acted like this was a new idea and a huge inconvienence.    We had seen the receptionist around the grounds on different occasions and being very friendly to others, but not to us.  We were baffled why not.  After staying one night, we wanted to have our room cleaned and a new bottle of water for drinking and the staff laughed at us and made side comments.  The restaurant was nice and"
40,"This is a very convenient hotel for visiting Tikal, particularly at sunrise, as it's right next to the park entrance. We met other travellers who'd bussed in from Flores for sunrise and we were very pleased we'd chosen to stay at the Jaguar Inn. Our room was fairly basic but comfortable, and there was a hammock on the patio outside which was a big bonus.  The meals at the hotel restaurant were good but there's also a tourist cafe at one of  the museums and another hotel next door.  Both Tikal museums are two minutes walk from the hotel.  We paid our park entrance fee on the afternoon we arrived and discovered our ticket could also be used the following day.  Having wandered round by ourselves at sunset the previous day, we found it was also worth going on the guided tour at"
40,"Tikal national park has only 3 hotels on its property and Jaguar Inn is one of them. It was relatively  cheap $60 for a huge room with a king size bed.  A strange thing about the room was that it didn't have any closet or shelves inside, so we had to store all our clothes on a bed and bedside tables. A room was very comfortable with huge windows. It had a hummock and a cushy bench outside so we could relax. Because this hotel is located in a jungle, all two stories buildings are surrounded by flowers and different tropical greens that make it even more romantic.  Personal didn't speak English but we managed to book a private guide to take us to Tikal. Josua was an excellent guide with a good knowledge and very good English too. Jaguar Inn has a nice restaurant as well."
40,"Keep in mind that Tikal doesn't lend itself to a luxurious stay.  That being said, I thought that the Jaguar was a good choice.  I stayed in several of the inns, and this was certainly the best.  The food was good (much better than the nearby places!), the prices were reasonable.  You can expect the electricity to run out in the very early evening, but the wifi was very convenient.  I thought that the staff was very friendly and accomodating."
50,"Was pleasantly surprise of how up to date this place was. Great rooms and food. They do have certain times that the electricity goes off, but it was not a problem for us.  Happy hour at the pool was fun with watching the monkey's and birds."
40,"There are only a few options for staying in Tikal. They all seem about the same and we were happy we stayed in the park. It's an amazing place. Jungle Lodge is pricey for what you get in terms of service and amenities, but well worth it for the location. And they know that, which is why everything is expensive. The room was pretty and clean. You only have electricity at certain hours but that made sense to us considering where we were and we didn't mind it. We didn't really enjoy the food at the restaurant (and it was pricey) but all the staff was very friendly.  "
40,Very clean and modern rooms.  Cottages set in the jungle. Lights go off in the cottages at  11:00 pm and come back on at 6:00 am. This should be a comfortable sleep in these rooms but it isn't. The Howler Monkeys start making their noise at about 1:30 in the morning. Then again at 3 pm and then again at 5 pm. It was worth the lack of  sleep to hear their strange sounds. The breakfast was nice but limited. The dinners  also had  a very limited menu.   Being within walking distance of Tikal Park was great. Over all this was a very nice Lodge. Even with its limitations I would recommend this hotel.
30,"Pros: good restaurant, excellent location.  Cons: staff a bit condescending, close to non-existent Wi-Fi, rooms are cheap and basic. For the price one would expect more, like private bathroom and breakfast. I guess the price pays the location. Which after being there I understand is not that important... any morning trip from Flores will do the trick."
50,"what a great place all around. right at the ruins site entrance. great food and a special thanks to Giovani for being absolutely AWSOME with our 5 year old.  Great clean rooms, mosquito nets on the beds, great food at the restaurant."
30,"Great Jungle Experience I would highly recommend this hotel, but you have to understand that this is not a 5 star hotel. It is a great bare bones place to stay to experience Tikal. My wife and I took the Avianca Flight from Guatemala City which arrived at 9AM. A shuttle driver was at the Flores airport to pick us up – we had paid for the service on Orbitz when we booked the room.  Once there, It took about 45minutes to get to the hotel. We had to pay the entrance fee to the park before getting to the hotel. The shuttle driver will stop by an ATM in order to get some Quetzales if you don’t already have some.  We booked a package for 2 nights that included breakfast and dinner along with either a sunrise or sunset tour each day. It seems that most people stayed only one night, but"
40,"If you go in knowing this is simply a place to eat and sleep, you will do yourself a favor. We stayed one night. I had my confirmation email, thank goodness. They did not have us down. Also, I asked for a jungle view and got a pool view. Oh well. The rooms were just fine. We slept comfortably and got up for our sunrise tour.  We used a separate guide for the sunrise tour. Francisco Florian. Wonderful! It was just the two of us and him. Some groups had anywhere from 15 up to 100 (the groups that come in after the park opens).  The food was not good. At all. And you dont want to drink tap water. Bottle water is there, but not included.  We wanted a cold drink at lunch, but they did not have any ice. :) Would I stay again? Yes, due to the proximity to the ruins."
40,"We loved staying at the Tikal Inn!  The place is really cute and the location is great, especially if you plan on taking a sunrise hike.  The hikes that they provide are great, so definitely take them if you can.  We did the sunrise and sunset - I would recommend both.  The service was a bit lacking there - I confirmed my reservation two months in advance via email with Ervin the manager which was challenging.  When I  got to the hotel, they didn't have my reservation even when I gave them my confirmation number.  They did have space for us so the problem was avoided, but that could have been a small disaster.    The food was decent and the beer was cheap, so that was a plus.  I would advise on bringing a flashlight to make navigating your room in the dark easier.  The pool is"
40,"The inn is right out the front of the park, so its location is ideal for spending a couple full days poking around the park. Obviously you need to set expectations, be prepared to be uncomfortable, have a flashlight, and not have all the creature comforts. But the beer is cold and the staff was pretty helpful. Also, there is a culture and archaeology tour here at around 10 a.m. led by an incredible guide named Juan. He has a really dry sense of humor but once it starts clicking he is pretty funny and his knowledge of the park, the plants, the animals and the archaeology was extensive. He would just rattle off long monologues that were really quite informative. For example someone asked about how the mayan hieroglyphs had been cracked. He proceeded to go on a 10 minute tour"
10,"We chose this place because of the good reviews on tripadvisor & our experience here was terrible. We loved the Maya ruins in Tikal but can not say the same about our stay at Tikal Inn.  Firstly, we booked a cabin room & requested a room by the pool. Bad mistake. We were given B6 which has the pump generator for the entire hotel located right behind the cabin, which made a loud & really annoying clicking noise. I initially asked reception what time the generator would come on in the morning & was told 8am. However, this was not true & we were rudely woken at 6:30am when we were hoping to have a sleep in. I then went to reception to complain to the guy who looked like the manager. He told me he would do something about it. An hour passed & I went back to reception & asked the"
40,"This is a fine place located directly inside the Tikal Archeological Park. Do not expect luxury here, you are paying for the location, which is perfect if you want to experience the jungle up close and take advantage of staying close to the ruins.  We stayed two nights at the only room of the inn that is not paired. Managing to get them to hold the reservation was a nightmare! We arrived in a late afternoon plane from Cancun, so it was impossible for us to secure the room by making a deposit in a Guatemalan bank or to get there before noon. We had to call every 15 minutes to let them know that we were on our way. They definitely need to start taking credit cards for reservations… Shower and bathroom were impeccable, cleaner than the room itself. Lights and hot water went out at"
30,"This hotel is at the entrance to Tikal. I recommend staying at Tikal at least one night because there are less people, more animals and better light in the mornings and the evenings. However, I would try one of the other hotels. The service was quite slow and sometimes unfriendly. The food was at best bland and way overpriced. Fortunately, the rooms were clean and well located."
40,"The only budget option for non-campers in Tikal National Park is the small Jaguar Inn. Hammocks, tents, bungalows offer accomodation for every budget. The landscaping is not only lovely, it attracts a variety of wildlife: hummingbirds, pisotes, monkeys. But the true gem is the Inn's restaurant - now with WiFi and computers.   When I guided in Tikal 30 plus years ago, a young British guide and her Guatemalan husband built what I felt the nicest facilities in the park. I spent many an evening trying to beat Patty at Scrabble or dominoes, and enjoying her delicious homemade bread, big fruit plates, and varied soups. Today the Jaguar Inn Restaurant seems amazingly the same, except baby Munditio is now handsome Edmundo with his own lovely 15-month Luna. Edmundo's menu still reflects"
40,"I thought this hotel was great. I was surprised about the electricity going off at 8pm but considering you are in the middle of the jungle I understood. And it made for a more romantic evening meal! Rooms are basic, but we had hot water and a comfortable bed so I have no complaints."
20,"I had a a bad experience at JAGUAR INN HOTEL. The food was not good at all, and over all, the services are overpriced.  I was amazed to see that the hotel only has 13 rooms, NO SWIMMING POOL, and other facilities that would be great to have if you are in the middle of the jungle, in such a hot environment.  Later I found that there was another hotel with a big, clean swimming pool and great food (the Tikal Inn Hotel).  I can't comment on the service of Tikal Inn because I didn't went there, but I COULD TELL YOU THAT JAGAR INN HOTEL IS TREMENDOUSLY OVERPRICED for the quality and service they provide which is very cheap."
30,"The lodge is superbly positioned for visiting Tikal for archaeology or birding. The lodge itself is well laid out and the accommodation (ours was a Jungle Suite) was excellent for a forest lodge with well designed, well serviced rooms, though the showers were mainly stone cold.  The service and food were dire. Although some staff members tried to please, the senior management treated us with contempt and on some occasions were rude and totally unhelpful / indifferent to our presence.  It also seemed easier for them to say ‘no’ to any request or tell you it would cost extra! On one occasion during our 3 day stay, our lunch was included in the day's tour. However, when we arrived, we were told we could not take lunch as it was not included.  A manager called Julio(?) was very"
40,"Hey TA'ers  After reviewing all the hotel deals in the area we went with Jungle Lodge, as it is actually the cheapest (if you are willing to go without a private bathroom!)  It is also the closest to the park (as everyone has written), but to be honest everywhere else is only a stone's throw further.  We got our double bed for $50/night.  The restaurant here is top notch and surprisingly affordable (for the area, you're getting charged more here in general cause you are in the park).    It has a pool and the shared toilets and showers are great - very clean and warm water too.  Wifi available only in hotel lobby.  If you want a sunrise tour go with an official park guide, no matter what anyone tells you.   They are the best informed and the most reasonably priced.  We had"
40,"You couldn't be in a better position for the visit to Tikal.  Yes the lights go out early and stay off until 6am, the water isn't the hottest and it isn't the cheapest but where is when in the middle of nowhere and almost a monopoly.  The room was clean and comfortable as were the beds (mosquito nets provided) and sat in bed listening to a Howler Monkey just outside the room was amazing.    Eating is not cheap but food okay.  We ordered a packed breakfast which was good but cost $6 but the friendly, helpful staff saved us $60 on a private car back to St Elena - yes there is an early morning bus despite what the travel agents in Flores tell you."
30,"While traveling in San Ignacio, Belize my husband and I made a spontaneous decision to visit Tikal since we were so close. At a friend's recommendation we stayed two nights at the Jungle Lodge. We weren't prepared for the conservative distribution of electricity nor lack of hot water. Can understand the reason for scarce electricity but for the price of the room expected at least warm water. Even though the room was spacious and clean it was hard to enjoy the space with shells from the trees above our room falling on the metal roof constantly.   The food choices at the restaurant wasn't exciting; however the wait staff was friendly and patience with our lack of Spanish. The front desk were helpful.   Overall our experience was uneventful expect for the tour of the Mayan Ruins."
30,"The best thing about Jungle Lodge is that it is literally in the Tikal National Park – and staying overnight is so much better than trying to do a day trip that it is worth the effort to do so. We spent two nights and were glad to have an entire day to explore the park.  I can't imagine running through it in a couple of hours!  What you must do is adjust your expectations because of where this park is located: at the end of a long rough road, off the grid in a jungle.  Given that, the place has some very nice features:  Beautiful gardens and paths, a great looking pool surrounded by a large deck area overlooking the jungle (bird feeders all around), a nice lodge and dining area, and you can walk out your door to the museums, crafts market and, of course, the trails to the ruins."
30,"The stuff is just really unfriendly, no customer oriented. Everything was a big deal for them. When guests wanted to change rooms it was a big problem for them. They didn't want to give new dinner/breakfast vouchers and the kitchen guys were chasing every guest to get the vouchers when serving meals. Also only one person was ""in charge"" of taking decisions in the hotel. Whenever I asked a staff member for anything they were looking at him or were sending me to go to ask directly him. He was the oldest of all all and had a moustache. Really unfriendly man.  The rooms are very basic but not too hot. I saw a cockcroach on the floor when I got up for the sunrise tour. The food was quite good. The electricity was only few hours per day but it wasnt a problem since we knew it before."
40,"Should have had a clue since our name was not on the hotel shuttle pick up list.  Had all my confirmations so they took us from the airport to the Hotel.   No Reservations in our name.  NEVER- DO NOT - BOOK ANYTHING THRU Jessica Ortiz.   There was also another couple there who had no reservations and made all their arrangemnts thru Jessica Ortiz as well.  Alfredo, the very patient front desk man helped us find two rooms for the evening!  I had booked way back in November to be sure to get two of the bungalows by the pool.  we ended up having a couple of rooms back behind the kitchen.  They actually worked out good, but still disappointed with Jessica!  How can she still be in business taking hotel reservations for this Hotel?  I have to say we had a wonderful experience doing"
40,"We booked a tour of the Tikal Mayan ruins with amigosjungletours.com and overnight lodging, dinner and breakfast was included.  The room was small, but adequate.  The beds were comfortable.  The location was great for the sunset and sunrise tours!  The meals were average, but what do you want for the middle of a jungle. Electricity is limited to a few hours in the morning, and a few hours at night.  Overnight sleeping was a little warm, but not a real issue.  Staff was friendly and helpful.  I would definitely recommend the inn for anyone wanting to visit Tikal."
20,"After reading the reviews of this establishment, I didn't expect much.  The hotel was as stated in the many reviews.  I stayed one night.  I would stay here again just to do the sunset and sunrise tours.  Pros-  LOCATION for sunrise and sunset tours!!!!!  Nice pool and outside grounds, nice waitstaff,   OK food.  Great tour guides!  Cons- Bug net needed (cockroaches and crickets all over floor when I woke up), bathroom needs renovating, noisy equipment behind room (water pump?), not enough air circulation and fan turns off at night.    ----  To those who would say, ""you're in the jungle, what do you expect?""  I have stayed at other places in the jungle and have not had these issues.  -----  TIPS--  - shower before going or have a light and sandals, - bring bathing suit,"
30,"Hotel was nice, comfortable room, a bit rustic, but given location this is reasonable. Cockroaches were a prolem and the bathroom was dingy. The pool was great There is electricity..maybe 6 hours -10 hours a day, but adequate for circumstances. After all you are miles from nearest power line in middle of a tropical jungle.  Hotel based guide was pleasant but poor English, poor tour skills, moved much too rapidly. He allow time for tour members to gather close before explaining things and left tour members behind in bathroom and disappeared with rest of tour group.  MAJOR problem. In spite of prepaid voucher, hotel insisted on running my VISA and charging the whole room stay (already covered by voucher) to my VISA. They then said the VISA was only for incidentals, but upon"
30,"You can't go that wrong being so close to Tikal, which was the highlight of our trip. We took full advantage of the Jaguar's Inn location, going to the park 3 times in 2 days. Our room was nice, and the ambience of using candles was romantic. Waking up to howler monkeys, especially if you're getting up for the sunrise tour is awesome. The food was quite good. They had an awesome soup, and their French toast was great.  Our main problem was mostly our fault. We didn't take out enough cash in Flores, so we ended up paying for our room and food using a tab that we paid each night with a credit card. Like most places in central America, they added a service fee. But it also seemed they added some other fees and taxes. I felt a bit scammed as we checked out. But overall the staff was"
30,"We stayed at the Jaguar Inn for two nights in March and ate at the restaurant several times. Be aware that this is a remote location and the power and hot water are only on at certain times of day (and not always reliably so!). The rooms are okay for the price, large but not scrupulously clean. We liked the food in the restaurant, it was the best value of the several places we tried at Tikal. Some of the staff were very nice, but  others gave the impression that they did not trust anyone, and they did not communicate well with us (although one member of the party is fluent in Spanish). The location is great, just a short walk from the park entrance, as is true of the two other accommodations here. I would recommend staying here over driving out to Flores or other nearby towns --"
30,"The hotel has basic amenities, however you can get what I would assume is a similar room at the hotel next door at the Hotel Tikal.  The price for the basic room is the same and they have a pool, since there is no wind and a lot of humidity that would have been nice.  There is no a/c or electricity at night, but I believe that is the entire area, not just the Jaguar Inn.  The restaurant at the hotel is very good though and are open even without the electricity.  This hotel has a backpacker vibe, which we were fine with, but people with families may not be.  The ruins far outweigh any negatives of the hotel, Tikal is SPECTACULAR!  Overall a good experience, but if i were to go back, i would stay at the Hotel Tika "
40,"After reading reviews that had problems with the reservation system at the Jaguar Inn I was a little worried but we had no problems at all. We arrived before 12:00 as our confirmation requested and our room was ready for us. The noise of the jungle, especially the howler monkeys, was just amazing even if it didn't make for a deep sleep!  The food in the restaurant was good, better that the meal we had at the Tikal Inn and a much nicer atmosphere. Make sure you take the sunrise tour of Tikal it can't be missed, magical! "
50,"We stayed two nights here at the beginning of April, and I would definitely recommend the Jaguar Inn highly as well as stay here again.  Firstly, a little about myself so you know what my perspective is:  I am a concierge at one of New York City's most exclusive boutique hotels, where rooms start at above $500 per night and go up from there.  I love elegant old-world hotels with lots of charm.  A few of my favorites are the  Crillon in Paris, the Ritz in Barcelona and the Huntington in San Francisco.  The Jaguar Inn is definitely not in this category.  Guatemala is a beautiful country and the people are wonderful, but it's also a very poor country where things don't always work the way one would like them to.  And, Tikal is in the middle of nowhere, so there's even less in the"
30,"Location is perfect, super close to the Tikal National Park. Staff was really nice, rooms are well equipped for the cold weather.  Staff never explain that lights went off at 10:00 PM and the use of hot water is limited.  In addition, we got bed bugs from their mattresses. Wifi was not working...I know we are in the middle of the jungle but you cannot offer services that you can't guarantee. Everything is really pricy inside the hotel, I would not recommend eat or get something there...they charge you for everything."
40,"We arrived in Tikal after getting up at 4 o'clock in the morning and getting to the Guatemala City airport at 5 AM for a 6 AM flight. It was too early to check into the hotel; so, we left our luggage in the main lobby and proceeded to explore the Mayan ruins. We were part of a large group, and several carried pedometers or iPhone apps. These gave us different readings of how much trekking we did through the day. But it is fair to say that we walked somewhere between 8 and 9 miles and climbed the equivalent of about 13 stories. Needless to say, by the time we arrived back at the Jungle Lodge, we were dead tired, caked with dust and mud from head to toe, and feeling completely grungy and dirty. Because of the size of the group, it took quite a while before we were assigned our"
30,"The Good: Amazing location! This hotel is right next to the park entrance, like 10 feet away. It is the perfect overnight spot for sunrise and sunset visits to Tikal. We were greeted by three howler monkeys in the trees above the hotel when we arrived. The hotel also did a good job of making you remember you are deep in the jungle (which you are) - nice landscaping and layout. The front desk staff was also helpful and courteous.  The Bad: The hotel room was a expensive for the price. Two small twin beds and a shared shower. We don't mind basic accommodations, but this was a bit overpriced. I would still stay here again though, just for the location. Internet connection was basically nonexistent. I'm fine with not having internet, but don't advertise WiFi if you can't deliver. "
50,After reading all the tripadvisor reviews on this lodge I was a little dubious at first about staying here but thought I would give it a try. I don't know what all the grumbling is about. This is a great hotel in the jungle at the entrance to Tikal. How perfect is that!!!! It is totally worth every penny.  It is not every day you can explore an ancient Mayan ruin. We had a travel agency in Antigua book the package deal of 1 night accommodation which was cheaper than doing it by ourselves. They picked us up at our hotel in Flores. We also picked up our guide in Santa Elena who provided us with a 3 hour informative tour of Tikal. The package price included lunch on the first day and breakfast in the morning. We stayed in a comfortable standard room with 2 queen beds. Hot water was
40,"The cheapest room was very comfortable for us (couple) with beautiful shared restrooms and showers just steps away. The restaurant food was good and the wifi was not. Highlights: closest hotel to the entrance, howler monkeys were shockingly loud, hotel gardens are gorgeous, pool was very nice and refreshing, staff was helpful, guide ($25 each with Roxy Ortiz was great, she's a native english speaker that grew up in Atlanta, archeologist that knows her Mayan history and can answer questions and a forensic anthropologist that worked on identifying human remains from the civil war...phenomenal knowledge and great teacher). Also, there were very interesting photos in the restaurant that showed archeologists that stayed in the Jungle Lodge and worked on the Tikal site in the 1900s."
40,"This place is all about the location. You are a 10 minute walk into the park!!  You will have the entire place to yourself at your disposal.  No waiting for tour buses, long drives early in the morning and the dreaded ride back. Wake up to an amazing sunrise tour which is included in most bookings here.  Walk back and enjoy a pretty good breakfast, relax at the clean refreshing pool and look around the hotel for monkeys.  Then in the afternoon head back for the sunset tour!! If you are only up for one I recommend the sunset over the sunrise.  Amazing views!! The rooms are basic and clean. but who comes here for the rooms!!!  It's all about your surroundings!!  Toucans, parrots, monkeys and beautiful flowers everywhere.  The staff was very friendly and the grounds were kept tidy."
30,"There are three hotels in the park, all within approximately a one-mile walk of the monuments.  All suffer from a minimal supply of electricity, eliminating the possibility of air conditioning in the torrid Guatemala climate.  The rooms were marginally clean and barely furnished.  However, the water was reliable and pleasantly warm.  The surrounding flora and fauna are lovely.  If you aren't too fussy, this is a convenient place to stay in the park."
50,Just know that you need to bring flashlights and be self sufficient. The sunrise tour is great. The food is tasty and the hotel is comfy. The pool is nice.  Tikal is amazing in the morning. Do not miss it.
40,"The staff was helpful and efficient. Although the room was definitely not a 5 star, it was better than the average for Guatemala and we were very comfortable. A good place to stay if you want to do the sunrise tour which I would recommend."
40,"If you want to watch pyramids during sunrise an sunset, this is good place to stay. Room was clean, but without electricity during the night and only cold water in the morning. No possibility to charge battery. Meal was OK."
40,"The Jaguar Inn next to the Tikal ruins was a great choice.  The room was large and situated in an apt. complex just minutes away from the park entrance.  The restaurant had great service, the food was very good after a long walk through the ruins.    Unfortunately we had to vanquish a giant cockroach in the night but this as well as the small snake sunning outside of our room the next afternoon were just an addition to an already exciting jungle experience (note: see the howler monkeys wake up at dawn by getting a tour that starts at 4AM, incredible experience).  can't beat the price for the location and opportunity to enjoy the ruins at your leisure.  Can get dinner at other hotels nearby if you like anyway so I don't think that should factor into your decision. "
50,"We absolutely loved our stay at the Jaguar Inn!!! It was much more than what these spoiled Americans expected!!! We woke up to the sounds of chattering jungle birds and monkeys!! The food was fabulous, the employees wonderful,and the accomodations were clean, quaint, and very enjoyable!! "
50,"The Jaguar Inn is the perfect place to stay when you go with the purpose of seeing and experiencing the Mayan ruins of Tikal.  The Jaguar Inn is right outside the ruins, meaning that you can get to the archaeological site early in the morning and at dusk, which are magical times there--the mist rises and you can feel the mystery of the place.  The hotel is inexpensive:  You can book a decent double room for $50, or rent a tent or even a hammock for just a few dollars.  The electricity and water go off, but on a schedule--take a good flashlight and maybe headlamp...it's a great adventure!  Believe it or not, there is an internet cafe right in the main lobby (which also serves as a restaurant and gift shop).  We saw tucans and a harpy eagle right on the hotel site!  Wow! "
40,"We originally planned to stay AND eat at the Jungle Lodge, but after dealing with the rude and unprofessional staff at the Jungle Lodge --both at the front desk and in the restaurant-- we revised our plans.  Unfortunately, we had already paid for our room so our option was to stay where we started, but not to eat another overpriced meal. So the Jaguar Inn became our refuge. The staff was friendly and courteous, and the food was better tasting, and made fresh with each order -- and half as expensive as the Jungle Lodge. Note too that the hours of service were very flexible. At the Jungle Lodge, diners had to sit and wait for the hour to strike 7pm before any food was served. At the Jaguar Inn, they would cook it when you wanted it. "
50,"We highly recommend that you stay at the Jaguar while visiting Tikal.  First off, by staying in the park you get to see the ruins and the wildlife in the mornings and the afternoons when there are few others in the park.  We had several complexes to ourself in the morning and saw several groups of monkeys that we wouldn't have seen otherwise.  Our room was large and spotless, the king bed quite comfortable, and reasonably cool at night even without air conditioning.  A large bottle of purified water was a nice touch.  The restaurant was ok, not great, we prefered the open air comedors near the visitors center.  Very pretty gardens. "
30,"If you want to do the sunrise from the top of temple 6 (which you definitely should!) then it's better to stay right in Tikal. We did for one night and then one night Flores which I thought was the perfect way to do it in a short space of time. Flores is also very nice and worth a visit. This hotel has the best location right next to the park entrance. The rooms were fine but it is a little pricey, especially the restaurant food and drink but there's no where else to go really! The little pool area is nice to relax but once again expensive drinks. The wifi didn't work anywhere whilst we were there. Probably the best thing about this place is the location right in the jungle with wildlife all around you. Bare in mind to stay here you have to pay the park entrance fee which is"
50,"The room is nice and clean. While we were there the pool had monkey viewing as a side show, that was great :) I cannot believe you can stay in a National Park in Guatemala for so cheap....AND hear howler monkeys in the evening. This part was spectacular!  If you think the logistics is too difficult to stay here overnight, you are wrong. Doing a day trip from Belize to Tikal, verses spending a night in Tikal is a shame. Staying in the park is an absolute must...and you can even take your 2 for 1 happy hour drinks into the park for the late afternoon park viewing. I have some amazing ruins shots with a couple of beer bottles. :)   As for logistics, you can take a collectivo or a bus from the Belize border to an intersection in El Remate. Then take a collectivo or a bus to Tikal."
20,"So shady. I am pretty sure they were constantly throttling the wifi, and lying about this too, which was extremely frustrating because my phone would show a full, strong signal, but I couldn't access anything. This was happening to a lot of other people too. I asked at the front desk and the guy was like, ""The connection is just bad right now, sorry."" And I said, ""My signal strength is great."" He's like, ""I think maybe you don't understand. I cannot help."" I eventually gave up. They also said they didn't have cots, and I'm not so sure that's accurate. On our second day there was NO hot water. I had to shower in freezing cold water. Patrons slammed doors around 3am onward. The hotel would not provide transport from the airport unless I emailed a photo of my ID and credit card."
40,"Stayed as part of a tour for two nights, on a bed and breakfast basis. Meals on offer are good, but prices are not budget end! Rooms are above basic, and offer everything you need. Electricity is generated on-site, and although they warn it is not on 24/7, in reality, it goes off after you are asleep, and comes on again before you get up. Their lodge is ideally based for visiting the extensive Mayan site of TIKAL, with the entrance only 5 minutes walk from your room. It's position offers a great way to maximise your time exploring the Mayan ruins. Recommended."
40,"We stayed in one of the bungalows with a shared bath. The bungalow was comfortable, clean, and quiet (except for an irritating bug that made a noise like electronic beeping; but that's life out of the big city!). The surroundings were beautiful. Electricity was only on from 5PM to 8PM each day, but why bother with electricity when you're out enjoying the ruins in the park?  Kevin, the desk attendant, was most helpful. He helped us arrange to exchange money in the park at a good rate and made outstanding recommendations.  One caution: If you're at all mobility-impaired (I need to use a cane sometimes), you may find the paths a little uncomfortable to navigate. They are intentionally made from rocks and are hence uneven and have sharp edges. Just a word of caution."
20,"Just because a hotel is in a national park/jungle doesn't mean you'd give that hotel great ratings where the same accommodation anyplace else in the world would be worthy of 1 or 2 stars.  The Tikal Inn is worthy of 2 stars max in my book.  I knew prior to my stay to temper my expectations and that I'd be staying in a place with limited electricity and hot water.  I came prepared with flashlights and portable fans (in the $10 price range on Amazon.com).  I had booked a junior suite for $125, but even with the free dinner, free breakfast, and free sunrise tour, I felt I would have been better off choosing their cheapest option.  My junior suite had 2 nice beds and a large bathroom, but that's about it.  There were spiders and all kind of various bugs which made it into my"
20,"If you can be off the grid, tolerate ants in the bathroom, get along without electric light and your smartphone and don't mind drinking your Chardonnay warm, you'll be fine.  And the better for it. The place is overpriced, but it has little competition.  Climb up to the top of the Temples. Enjoy the view. (And yes, the generator only runs from 0600 - 1000 and from 1800 - 2200, so take a flashlight.)"
40,"The rooms are pretty basic but it's in the jungle after all.  That said, the outdoor swimming pool is a welcome luxury and the staff are friendly and helpful.  I actually forgot some of my luggage at the Flores airport and the hotel staff called the airport to confirm it was there, and then next morning a shuttle driver returned it to the hotel for me - Thank you.  The guides the hotel offered were knowledgeable and spoke English well.  It's ideal location - within the park, allows you to just walk from the hotel to the admission booth.  Tip: Ask where, on the hotel grounds the coati hang out."
50,"We stayed at the Tikal Inn for only one night. Our priority was to do the sunrise tour so staying on the edge of the park was a necessity.   Super staff!: We arrived in the late afternoon, earlier than expected, with still some light in the sky. The staff at the Tikal Inn was extremely welcoming and accommodating when we wanted only to drop our bags and try to make it up to the ruins before the sun went down. I know these details sounds superfluous for a review but I wanted to emphasize how great the staff was because I've read other reviews that weren't as positive in this respect. It's worth mentioning that although I don't speak Spanish and had a bit of trouble explaining ourselves, the guys at the desk were extremely helpful and flexible.  We also found that the restaurant"
50,"Although it is possible to visit Tikal as a day trip from Belize, I highly recommend staying at least one night.  After studying the options, I chose Tikal Inn because it was within easy walking distance of the park, surrounded by rainforest and had a swimming pool to relax in during siesta when it’s too hot to be visiting the park or birding.  We stayed 2 nights and got in on a special deal that included a free sunrise or sunset tour, breakfast, dinner and a shuttle to Flores.  Package deals change from time to time so always email them to ask what’s going.    Tikal Inn isn’t found on any of the typical online hotel booking sites such as Expedia or Hotels.com so you have to contact them direct.  They take credit cards to pay your final bill.  Wifi is available in the lobby"
30,"We stayed at the jungle lodge as part of a tour package for visiting Tikal National Park.  The Jungle Lodge has a phenomenal location, just a short walk from the main entrance to the park grounds.  It was a nice headquarters for 2 busy days of visiting the amazing Mayan city.   We stayed at the Jungle Lodge at the beginning of the tourist season, so there were only a few other guests and a lot of work being done to prepare for the high season.  The work being done was minimally disruptive.  We did note that there were very few options available at the restaurant, but again, as it was low season with few other guests, we were neither surprised or disappointed.  The food that was available was fine. Our room was very nice.  We had a wonderful wildlife encounter with a group of"
30,"This hotel was a disappointment.  The location in the middle of the jungle and next to the Tikal ruins is fantastic! You really feel in the middle of the wilderness, particularly when you wake up in the middle of the night to the howler monkeys...a great experience! However, other than the location, there is not much more I liked about this hotel. The rooms are average, the bathrooms terrible with very limited hot water and no water pressure. Although they advertise wifi...it works very sporadically.  The service is OK and food overpriced and not particularly good. When going here don't expect the type of excellent jungle lodges you can find in Costa Rica or Peru."
50,"My family stayed in two rooms in the hostel portion of the Jungle Lodge overnight and loved it.  The hostel rooms are clean, comfortable and safe, and you have access to the pool, restaurant and wifi of the hotel portion without extra charge.  The people were friendly and the location is right by the entrance to Tikal, which is just awesome.m so many different temples and palaces from the Maya civilisation!"
40,"A lovely setting minutes from the entrance to the ruins and full of atmosphere.  The rooms were individual bungalows set in the jungle with plenty of space, deep mattresses, spotlessly clean sheets, four fluffy pillows and good mosquito nets.  I did see something wriggle under the spare bed and didn’t care to find out what it was and there was a rather large spider happily curled up in one of my towels which crawled for cover as I picked it up but it’s all part of jungle life and as long as you aren’t too squeamish about such things then you should be fine.   The jungle noises surrounding you are so exciting and the fact that there’s no electricity between 10pm and 6am just adds to the fun but just make sure you have a torch handy, and of course that you charge phones and"
30,"Jungle Lodge misses the mark: 1. Stephanie on front desk is untrained in hospitality. 2. We booked a top room and were initially checked into an average room. When we brought it to Stephanie's attention, she changed us to a junior suite. 3. Junior Suite was outstanding: beautifully and charmingly appointed--quite amazing and unexpected in the Guatemalan jungle! HOWEVER: Our shower only had hot water one out of three days. And when it did have hot water, we had to wait about 15 minutes before it delivered. 4. The manager?/owner? offered us dinner in compensation. When we finished dinner, we were presented with a bill for the two glasses of wine we'd had with the dinner. Really classy. 5. Lodge advertises Wi-Fi but it's in and out--mostly out. 6. Otherwise, the location of the"
50,"My husband and I stayed one night at the Jaguar Inn in March 2006.  I reserved in advance on-line and prepaid for the room, and there was no problem when we got there.  We had a standard room with a private bath.  The room was so luxurious!  We had a king sized flat futon bed, the bathroom was brand new with a fantastic, new-age shower, there were charming little candles provided for when the power shuts down after 9pm, and the service was excellent. This inn also allows camping, so there are lots of tents in the yards, and they have an area where you can rent a hammock. There was a broad range of guests, from the earthy campers to the more upscale crowd. We ate at the restaurant twice, and we were really impressed with the quality of food.  Just excellent all around.  The"
40,"I had the opportunity to stay in the Jaguar Inn in November of 2004. It was by far the best of the three hotels in the park for me. I spent my first 2 nights in the park at the famous Jungle Lodge, then 1 night at the Jaguar. Even when I was at the ""lodge"" I went to the Jaguar for meals after the first day. It is a travellers style hotel, relatively clean(by Guatemalan jungle standards), laid back and not full of North Americans upset because everyone doesn't speak English. The Jungle Lodge on the other hand was full of non spanish speaking rude and uppity North Americans who were busy trying to show off for each other. Yes I am from North America too, but am often embarrased by my countrymen. The food is ok- you're in the jungle, the restrooms get a bit icky-you're in the"
10,"I WAS a fan of the Jaguar Inn.  I stayed there in March 2004 and enjoyed the location / food.  When I booked a repeat stay in March 2005 I hoped to repeat the experience.  I received an on-line confirmation which I then re-confirmed as directed.  The rooms are held without deposit and as long as you get there before noon your room should be held.  When I arrived at 10:30 AM they informed me that had no room for me.  I showed them a printout of the confirmation e-mail with the name of the individual I was talking to - but they denied the authenticity of the e-mail.  I went next door to the Jungle Lodge where they informed me that the Jaguar Inn has a habit of overbooking and taking first come first serve leaving many travelers out of luck.  TRY THE JAGUAR INN, BUT DO NOT EXPECT"
10,"This is by far the worse Inn i've ever stayed in in my entire life.  My friends and I stayed in a quad for one night in Feb 2005 for ~$100.  The bathroom was the most disgusting bathroom i've ever laid eyes on.  The entire place was dim, dingy, and dirty.  The mattress was springy and the sheets saw right through the mattress.  Although I slept with a long sleeve shirt, long sleeve pants and socks, my friend and I both got bitten by bed bugs.  I left Guatemala with over 60 bed bug bites all over my legs.    If i had to do it all over again, I would make Tikal a day trip or stay someplace else.   Although we woke up at 4am to see the sunrise, it was so cloudy that we could barely see anything. "
40,"Stayed here 2 nights in early December and really enjoyed our stay. It is not meant to be a luxury accommodation. But, for what it is - simple, clean, budget accommodations in a great, peaceful location - it was excellent value for money. We stayed in a double w/private bathroom for less than $US 50.   The rooms and facilities are basic, but clean and comfortable. Like many jungle inns, there is some mildew in the bathrooms, but that is hard to escape in this climate no matter where you go :). The grounds are lush and beautiful, and you can fall asleep and wake up to the sounds of monkeys, jaguars, and other creatures. It's a very peaceful environment. You're a one-minute walk from the entrance to the ruins, the museums, and the visitor center - this made it easy for us to do a"
30,"Booking and confirmations were very spotty. Their North American number no longer works, and they are very slow or completely forgetful with confirmations. They also failed to pick us up as requested at the airport. We hired a taxi driver instead, who said one of the competitors was more expensive, but  put more attention into the details. He wasn't kidding. Tired, worn, any past glories have long since passed. I'm sure this is not news to the management. Their competition is only two other nearby inns. We had booked a package that didn't include transpo (it's all very confusing). Like everything else, e.g. inept book keeping, poor organization of dawn tour---it's a but of a gong show Yes there is limited hydro, I can live with this and have many times before in remote places."
40,"This hotel is about being disconnected from the world. Go with zero expectations on hot baths, quality of wi-fi service and cell phone reception and you will be fine. Carry cereal bars or other snacks and mosquito spray. The location and setting more than compensate once you adjust your expectation. Rooms are large, comfortable and clean as are bathrooms. There is no hot water till 7pm - and when you have hiked all day, you may be tempted as we were just to have a quick cold shower or use the refreshing pool.. Wifi is patchy and served in two batches, morning is good, evening is terrible. Electricity comes on at 6pm-10pm. Food is very basic as it all has to be carried in. However the staff really try to work with what they have, we went with our six year old who needed dinner"
10,"After a ten hours drive in the country and an hour flight I arrived in this hotel, I was told after ten pm I had to go in my room as they were no light untill 6 am. No electricity at all. So I have traveled enough all over Africa and south america this can happen but they give a little candle. if a man has walked over the moon they can have a light in these kind of hotels with their budget which  of course they have, later one of the guys who worked there told me the owners don't want to put any money into services . I asked them if it is possible to have a candle and the response was no. And they tell you this way you feel the nature being locked in, in your room in prison in the dark. It has been a terrible experience, if you come here bring your candles or a torch, and I hope"
20,"The hotel has a great location. The staff is not very friendly or enthusiastic. Billing issues seem to be a common thing. There were issues with our bill and we met other people who also had to fight for proper billing. The electricity is delivered in two installments - the morning installment comes when pretty much everybody is already in the National Park. It is simply useless. The check-out time is extremely inconvenient for visitors to the national park. The rooms (most of them in separate little bungalows) are too close to each other - one can hear every word from your neighbor, as well as what happens in their bathroom! The surroundings are beautiful, we enjoyed seeing many exotic animals just outside our room. Considering all inconveniences and the unfriendly staff, the"
40,"Actually, I was overprepared for 'roughing' it. It turned out quite comfortable, good food, nice grounds. Beds were comfortable and the rooms were clean. I wouldn't want to stay there more than a couple nights. The town of Flores, however, would be a good 2 night destination as well. A very cute island town no one talks about. We wish we had stayed there rather than San Ignacio!  It was cool waking up at 4 am and listening to the jungle wake up as we hiked to our destinations. We were traveling as a group of 10. We left Belize for one overnight at Tikal. The wonderful Ricardo Ortiz and his daughter Jessica were responsible for booking our reservation, providing the transportation from San Ignacio where we were staying. They suggested we take a slight detour on our way to Tikal"
30,"We stayed here so we could do a sunrise tour, which we also booked through the hotel. They did not let us add it to our hotel bill and pay with card, so we had to use all of our remaining cash to pay for the tour. Abel, the guide was strange and incoherent during the tour and we did not feel like we got any sort of good overview of Tikal. We were disappointed with the tour and do not recommend booking through the lodge!! Also someone decided it would be a good idea to bring their crying baby to the top of the temple, which ruined the entire experience of having a peaceful sunrise atop the temple, and listening to the birds and animals wake up - there are also a lot more people than we thought on top of the temple (not hotel's fault but I thought I'd mention this for people"
30,"Right at the entrance to the Tikal National Park, staying here gives you the freedom to visit the ruins when you want: we had a guided tour in the morning then returned on our own in the afternoon to explore further. A map of the site can be purchased for 20 quetsales from the park staff at the gate. The hotel itself is fairly simple - a number of rectangular bungalows around a single open-plan bar/shop/reception/dining room. An unexpected bonus was a swimming pool, though we didn't actually make use of it. The accommodation is clean, fairly basic but perfectly suited for a one-night stopover to visit Tikal. The windows are mesh to keep out the bugs and there is a mosquito net over each of the queen-sized beds. There's not much storage space or surfaces to put things on. The"
10,"Unfriendly staff, dodgy quality, overpriced meals, poor internet access, no mobile access (in 21 century this can be done even in the jungle), erratic hot water availability.  On top of this there is common predatory pricing of transfers to/from Flores (and Flores Airport) for those unsuspecting and naive.  There is no reason whatsoever to stay here overnight - the ruins are best seen and visited as a day tour from Flores or Santa Elena.  Location of the hotel is only good for the ruins, it cannot be used to explore the surrounding region because a Park Fee of USD 20 must be paid per day (if travelling outside the Park) regardless of whether you visit the ruins or not."
40,"I booked my stay thru my favorite tour company, Ecotourism & Adventure Specialists. The Jungle Lodge is located very close to the entrance to the park. I spent three days at the lodge and enjoyed every minute of it. True, the power gets shut off at night, but since I always pack a flashlight, I had few problems. The lodge has several bungalows located around the restaurant and office. The bungalows are connected by cobblestone paths that can be very slippery at times so beware. There is a very nice outdoor pool located nearby as well. The meals I had at the restaurant were very good and the staff was most accommodating. I recommend this hotel and hope to return to the spectacular ruins at Tikal in the future."
50,"My first time to Guatemala and I'm Smitten. After a long journey, we were welcomed at the beautiful Jungle Lodge in Tikal National Park by a very warm courteous staff. We stayed in the cool and serene Master Suite, which was just stunning. The carved wood furniture and the lush tropical surroundings were very relaxing. The outdoor/indoor showers and the beautiful bathtub were just what I needed. The sounds of the jungle in the evening and overnight were magical. The restaurant in the lodge provided a decent selection and excellent service. The pool was beautiful and refreshing and everything was very clean. I was very pleasantly surprised and will definitely return."
50,"We chose The Tikal Inn as our lodging while we were in the park to see the Tikal Maya ruins.  It is a very comfortable lodge, but I recommend that you get a room in the big building rather than the poolside cabanas.  The cabanas are attractive, but the noise from the pool is loud and disturbing.  Also, there was an odor from the system they use for the toilets.  It wasn't too bad with the bathroom door closed, but a room upstairs would solve that problem.  Another annoyance was the sound of what I assume was a water pump that went on just about every 30 seconds when the electricity was on.  Yes, that's right, the electricity goes off every night at 10pm and I think it was off between 10am and 3pm.  It was hard to get my phone and ipad charged.  The shower was just a trickle in"
10,"We stayed 1 night in this inn so as to visit Tikal conveniently.   An inn suggests hospitality, decent service, decent  food, cleanliness.  This Inn had none of the above. This was our experience: Surly staff at the front desk. Waiter who said that there was no room in the dining room for dinner at 7  p.m. although we could see many empty tables. Nice people offered to share their space with us. Any item we ordered on the menu, the waiter said was not available. The food had no eye appeal and tasted just as bad, including the coffee. The room was stark with many bugs on the bed, on the bathroom sink. The electricity is shut off for many hours at night and during the day. There is no sound proofing and people leaving for sunrise tours of Tikal could be heard leaving for their 4"
40,"Within short walk of the archaeological site so after a guided tour, which is highly recommended you can go back for another look and to take in the sunset on the same day ticket. Its not a fancy place but rooms are of a decent size with 2 beds and comfortable. It also has a small pool and everywhere is nice and clean. Dont expect great food. The menu is very limited and portions are not large but then you're not visiting for a gastronomic experience and most people are only hee one or two nights. Its great to wake to the sounds of the jungle and far better to stay here than el remate or flores which are 30 mins and 60 mins away respectively"
50,"First of all, my husband and I would like to personally thank the manager and staff who went out of their way to install a battery in our room in order for my husband's CPAP machine to work all night long. This was such a class act on their part, especially given their admirable respect for the environment in their use of electricity. This also really ensured a very comfortable and healthy sleep for my husband. Secondly, we quite enjoyed  all of our meals while we were there...the fish was delicious and the waitstaff  very friendly and attentive. So much better than we were expecting... Thirdly, we loved our bungalow by the pool! It was refreshing at the end of the day to be able to take a dip to cool off after visiting the ruins. We even met many people from around the world"
40,"The Inn was nice, but a bit quirky. We arrived at about 5.30 and were told that the electricity was only on in the rooms between 6 and 10pm. We were in the 'cheap seats' at the back and had to walk down a wood chip path in the dark to get back to the room in the evenings. The rooms were very basic and the shower was cold. The surroundings on the other hand are fantastic. You can walk into Tikal National Park to the Mayan site and there were lots of animals in the area. The highlights of my stay were the Mayan site and the animals, Coatimundi, Agouti and wild turkeys were running around in the hotel grounds and howler monkey in the trees. Enjoyed my stay there, but not because of the room."
10,Stay away from the food.  Got a moldy burger bun among other things.   Most of the staff speak some english but will act as though you must pantomime through everything until you catch on.   Tin roofs under trees which bang debris loudly all night.   Apparently all male staff. 
40,"I was quite apprehensive about staying in Tikal. From what I had read, I expected to find poor accommodations. Instead I was very pleasantly surprised by our Junior Suite at Jungle Lodge Tikal; the room was spotlessly clean, very recently renovated, and downright beautiful. The room was spacious and had a large bed with mosquito net. There was also a sofa bed (with no mosquito net). The bathroom was gorgeous, with a soaking tub, and two showers -- one indoors and one outdoors (yes, outdoor shower with wood slats on three sides for privacy). The room would be suitable for Architectural Digest. This was the nicest room of the three hotels we stayed in on this trip.  The room could have been more comfortable had there been air conditioning, but we knew in advance there would not"
40,"Jungle Lodge is extremely well located for any visit to the National Park. Our room was new or very recently renovated. Ok size, very nice bathroom. Breakfast at the restaurants works well. Nice pool area. Generator only runs part of the day"
10,"SUMMARY: NO POWER AT NIGHT. I am the last person to be diva-ish about lodging facilities, but when you pay over a hundred bucks for overnight accommodations and the power is deliberately turned off between 10 PM and 6 AM to 'conserve electricity', I have a problem. They also switch off power after 8 AM so you really get electricity between 6 and 8 in the morning. I get that there is no AC at this price, but it doesn't seem right that they can't even manage to keep a ceiling fan running through the night in the rooms, when there are holiday lights lit up in the trees (we were there in the last week of December).  As a result, all windows must be kept open - if there are any holes in the mosquito netting, you will be dead meat. Forget about wifi, you need to try it in the main"
50,"Had a great 2 night stay in a private cabana at the Jungle Lodge.  Room was very comfortable and everything worked just fine.  Arrived around noon and had to leave bags in the dining room so we could explore Tikal.  No problem checking in.  Found the staff quite pleasant.  Didn't eat on site so can't comment on the food.  Do bring a flashlight -- once the generator is out, it is very dark at night.  Also, be aware that they seem to be doing some construction during the day...not a problem since we were mostly at the great Mayan site."
40,"Stayed in the budget accommodation section with a shared bathroom.  Definitely worth the extra expense rather than making the long drive back to Flores if you want to spend a full, tiring day visiting the park. The rooms we clean and nice and definitely offer an up close jungle experience. The negatives were the weak water pressure and not continuous electricity (somewhat to be expected and forgiven considering the location), and the food. The restaurant is overpriced and left us feeling hungry."
40,"This is a lovely place to stay in the jungle, particularly if you want to do the sunrise tour, which is included with your accommodation. Bring flashlights/headlamps for the tour since it is dark when you depart. The grounds are very pleasant and having a swimming pool was definitely a plus because it does get very hot during the day. The bungalows are simple but spacious enough. You can spot some animals on the property (spider monkey, etc..). Based on other reviews, I thought that the food would be poor, but we thought it was about average, and really had no complaints. There isn't too much variety, but considering you are in the jungle, it's nothing to complain about. If you plan on getting drinks, it is a bit on the expensive side (2 drinks for 100Q). There is a market a few"
40,"I thoroughly enjoyed this place. The accommodations are very comfortable considering the location. I would recommend getting the jungle side haciendas because you are away from the pool noise and you can sit on your porch and watch Coatis, wild turkeys, toucans, spider monkeys right from the chair on your porch.  Plus the place is just a short walk from the park entrance so you can partake easily of the sunrise and sunset tours which avoid the tourist crush during the day. Believe me it is a totally different experience. One negative thing, the food is not anywhere near gourmet. It's pretty bland fare but the service is very friendly and prompt. I guess you can't have everything."
40,"This is a fun place to stay, and a great launching point for touring Tikal -- especially if you want to do one of the sunrise or sunset tours.  They arrange the tours and you walk out the front door into the park.  The pool is quite nice.  Most things are fine, nice and quaint.  There'll be howler monkeys in the trees in the parking lot.  BUT be aware:  This is in the jungle.  They have generator electrical power for a few hours in the morning and a few hours at night.  Same for the internet.  Same for hot water.  Sometimes I had no water at all.  Of course there's never air conditioning.  The service is friendly and good, but of course they are dealing with the same limitations of power, water, etc.    If your personality can live with this style of place, you'll have a fine"
40,"Nice location, right at the entrance to the park, so you can see the sunrise from the top. But it is usually not overcast. It is alright for one or two nights. The food is decent and the sound of the howler monkeys in the morning is always a pleasure."
30,extremely slow restaurant service. rooms are ok but nothing more. very friendly and helpful receptionists. annoying with all the periods where the electricity off and only so-so wifi. found it did the trick for a one-night stay and a visit to tikal
40,"The hotel is located in the Tikal park which is very convenient to visit the ruins. There was a problem with our reservation and the manager upgrade us with no extra cost, however the guy at the front desk kept reminding us about this benefit every time he saw us, which became very annoying.. at the end we understood he was looking for a tip (and we did). The room was very nice and comfortable. The food at the restaurant was just ok and the service very slow. The wiffi connection never worked for more than 10 minutes. We arrived to the park before 3pm and we had to pay a full entrance, so be aware to arrive after 3pm otherwise you´ll be charged for that half day and the following days you stay at the park. The hotel never mentioned that in the booking confirmation which I"
30,We decided to stay in the park to avoid the back and forth driving to Flores. We did the sunset and sunrise tour so staying in the park made sense. The room and facilities was nice but the staff was terrible. They were very unfriendly and one waiter at dinner the night before tried to tell us the only way we could see the sunrise was on a $30 per person guided tour which was not true at all. Food and the restaurant was decent but quite expensive. Rooms and bathrooms were clean and quiet which is basically what you're spending your money on.
40,"We stayed here for a night in Tikal to give ourselves the chance to see the sunrise and sunset at Tikal, and would highly recommend this hotel. The location here is right next to the park, in prime real estate, and boasts beautiful jungle grounds, and nicely appointed rooms. We stayed in a recently renovated room, with king bed. The bathroom was great, full of light with a skylight over the shower. Screened in windows without glass made us feel like a part of the jungle, enjoying all the jungle sounds, without concern that we might end up with unwanted critters in our room. We felt very safe here.  The wardrobe in the room is not attached or anchored to the wall, and almost toppled over on us when we went to try to open it, so be careful with that - hopefully they fix this soon."
50,"we stayed in the very recently renovated junior suite. The bungalow had a modern design, large double bed and plenty of space. Nice extras were a shower and terrace outside with jungle view and bathtub, which is very pleasant after a day's walk in the park with the hot and humid climate. Hot water all day, electricity at specific times (which is normal for hotels at tikkal). Wifi was slow in the bungalow, but slightly better at the reception / restaurant. The restaurant did not have ambiance, but the food was good. We saw five monkeys in the trees next to the swimming pool, which was pretty amazing. The best feature of jungle is the location, you are literally in the park, even beyond the second ticket booth."
30,"Stayed here in a large group, using it as a base to explore Tikal and the surrounding rainforest. The staff were adequate, but as the headline suggests the location is the only reason to stay here. we stayed in tents in the camping area, maybe the rooms are nicer? Tikal will always be one of my most favourite places in the world, but I would look at staying else where for a touch more comfort."
50,"We decided to switch from a night in el relate to a night in the Tikal national park. Great location and a short walk to the ruins. When we arrived we had booked a room with a shared bathroom by mistake. The staff happily upgraded is with no hassles! The rooms were very clean, comfortable beds and the atmosphere in the place was comfort Eco living in the jungle. Wildlife all over the place and a beautiful large restaurant with some really tasty meals. We got engaged at the top of the ruins that day and the staff were so nice in getting us a bottle of wine to celebrate! Would recommend this place to anyone."
30,"I was so excited about our stay here, but the arduous check in & check out process pretty much ruined our first night there. It took over 90-minutes to get us settled in & this was after a long travel day from Antigua. The staff seemed oppressed & beaten down by management, so i don't blame them, but rather the owners/manager.    Rooms were basic, but nice.  It is the best location in Tikal & actually inside the ticketed guard gate to enter the park. The other two hotels are only a tenth of a mile away or so.  We did have monkeys (howler & spider) in the trees, as well as a toucan (keel billed).  We needed to add an extra person in our shuttle from Flores & after some back & forth with management it was allowed & for an added fee, but they acted like we asked them for the moon."
40,"This is not a 4 star hotel, but it gets my 4 stars based on location! We stayed in a bungalow which was nice, not fancy but clean and comfortable. Loved the 50s vibe of the whole place, the history of which was fascinating. Met aging original owner archeologist  Antonio Ortiz and could maybe imagine what it was like to explore Tikal back in the days when it was just being discovered. Loved being able to just cruise out to the ruins in the morning. Totally worth it, I'd do it again."
20,Scabby!! Tiny room. Staff not friendly or helpful. Wouldn't give free drinking water refill even when I asked!   No cover between toilets/shower area and rooms so get soaked. Electricity off at night but also was off at midday when we came back from walk. Restaurant expensive too. Terrible value overall. 
40,The Howler monkeys wake you up at 4 am. Power is off 11 pm - 6 am and in the afternoon. The wifi is absolutely terrible but it is everywhere around Tikal. The food is ok. They shoo you out of the restaurant area in the afternoon. I guess they are saving generator power.   Front desk staff was helpful. You should try one of the independent  restaurants for a change of pace.
50,"I stayed at the Tikal inn for one night. I enjoyed the bungalow because I sat on the porch after hiking the ruins all day, and watched the wild turkeys, and coatimundi and monkeys. It is a fantastic setting. The food was excellent and the waiters were friendly and efficient. Be prepared with a flashlight because there is no power except for generators inside the park. I would definitely stay here again."
40,Would stay here again just to wake up to the Howler Monkeys. Pretty standard rooms and liked the fact the power gets shut off at night. Makes things very quiet and it's a great feeling in the jungle. Can't beat the location for an early morning walk to the Temples (No people anywhere!!!).
30,"The staff is very friendly. The rooms were clean and respectable for the price. Glad our stay was during a cooler time of year as there is no A/C and the hotel only has power for lights, hot water and wifi (in main lobby only) from 6pm-10pm. We did the sunrise tour which is a must! Watching the sunrise over the Jungle as it awakes is amazing. I couldn't imagine traveling to Tikal for just a day trip. While it was warm and humid at the hotel, it gets cold sitting at the top of the temple in the dark especially if it is windy. Bring flashlights and bug spray!"
30,"Hotel Tikal Inn is convenient.  The setting is beautiful and you can walk right to the ruins.  Keep your eyes open for all kinds of fun birds and animals. The rooms are very sparce.  They only have electricity for a few hours in the morning and few in the evening, so be prepared with flashlights and charging during those times. There is a pool which are kids thoroughly enjoyed even tho it's nothing fancy.   The food was fine. We did the sunrise tour.  The idea is really good.  However, we were with a bunch of buffoons who insisted on chatting and using their smartphones (or other lit up bits of technology).  Climbing to the top of temple #4 in the dark, sitting there soaking up the silence (when they stopped talking), listening to the animals and watching the sunrise could be"
40,"Stayed in one of the detached bedrooms around the garden, very nice. Ideally located just outside the entrance to Tikal. Good swimming pool. Complimentary shuttle bus from airport which is a necessity (at scheduled flight times only). Electricity only within certain hours. Wi-fi available (although understandably patchy), but guest computer out of action. Evening meals are average. Went on the sunset and sunrise tours that you can take as part of the package, their guide was excellent."
30,"The lodge is in a nice area and perfect for the TIKAL park. The room was very small and we had no real place for our baggage. Power was available only for few hours and therefore we had to sleep in small room without ventilator and air-condition....quite hot. Nice enviornment but the staff use the stone way to destroy our baggages roles.  Good restaurant, but no real lodge feeling and too expensive due to the exclusivity."
50,"We felt like spoiled backpackers when we were the only 2 people of the bus who stayed at Tikal. It was really amazing to spend time at the lodge after visiting Tikal. We had booked the private room instead of the semi-private because the last one smelled a bit funny. But the shared bathrooms were very clean! After our Tikal tour, we took a dive in the nice pool. Hereafter, we went back in the park (about a 15 minutes walk). It's so nice to have this opportunity! The room (spacious and nice bathroom) and the rest of the lodge is really clean and well maintained. The staff is also nice and helpfull and the food was okay. We had such a nice experience to sleep a night in the jungle where you can hear al the sounds of the animals!"
30,"The Jungle Lodge is right inside the park which makes it super convenient for visiting Tikal. After our tour we were able to explore the ruins at our leisure.  The beds were not that comfortable and there were a few bugs that crawled their way into the room by using the crack in the door.  The pool looked a bit dirty so we didn't swim. The food wasn't that great, but there are some options next door that were better. There was a scorpion crawling on the floor of the restaurant - yikes!  There is a nice garden area outside of the lodge where you can see up close toucans and monkeys (howler and spider)!  We took the sunrise tour to Temple IV which was absolutely amazing. The Jungle Lodge is primitive (not romantic), but I would definitely recommend it for the location! It's truly"
40,"We stayed in the Hostel part of Jungle Lodge Tikal. The shared shower and toilet were mostly clean and well-kept. The rooms are facing jungle and that´s really nice. It really feels like you are in the middle of nowhere. The rooms are basic, but clean and fine. Only thing that was a bit annoying - the windows are just adjustable shields and of course are absolutely not soundproof. So not much privacy as you can hear absolutely everything going on outside or in the other rooms. Though nice to listen to sounds of jungle at night and early morning.  The hotel is in a really nice setting and very well maintained. It´s right next to the entrance to Tikal Park so the location is absolutely great. They also have a very nice swimming pool and poolside area - great after hiking around"
40,"Stayed here one night in order to do the sunrise hike in Tikal. Accommodation is basic but clean. The electricity (presumably from a generator) was sporadic and the wifi signal was virtually non-existent. The food was average although expensive. That all being said, the lodge is situated in the middle of the jungle and yet is still relatively comfortable. It is also the closest to the Mayan ruins (for the tours). Tony, who has lived at the lodge for nearly his entire life, proved to be a very capable tour guide and the sunrise hike was truly breathtaking. Well worth a visit. "
50,"My husband and I stayed here for 1 night in December 2013.  I have NO IDEA why anyone would want to day-trip Tikal vs. spend a night here.  It was an amazing experience.  Prior to our arrival at the Tikal Inn we were staying at the Macal River Camp @ Chaa Creek in San Ignacio, Belize.  Via e-mail with the Tikal Inn, I was able to arrange for the Tikal Inn shuttle (operated through Mayan Heart World) to pick us up at Chaa Creek and transfer us to the Inn.  We exchanged money USD for quetzals at the Belize/Guatemala border for a good rate (you'll need 300 quetzals (~$40 USD) to enter Tikal National Park).  We were at the Tikal Inn by 10:30am, which was wonderful.    We checked into our bunglao (clean & comfortable) and immediately headed into the ruins.  Bring bug spray &"
40,"This place was inside the actual park so the location is idea. The hotel itself is quite cute and the rooms were very clean. The staff were all quite nice and the place just seemed to be well run.  They organize a free sunrise tour to the top of the tallest temple to watch the jungle awaken as the sun rises over the ruins. It is DEFINITELY worth getting up at 4am for this! The food was pretty basic (ie not very good)... but it was fine. Plus when you factor in that the price of the hotel often includes transport to&from Flores, breakfast & dinner, the tour, etc. it ends up being a great deal!"
50,"clean , basic room.   shared bath and toilets which were kept spotless.   next to several dining choices.   they turned off the generators at 9:30 p and it was nice listening to the jungle at night w/o light pollution.   seemed to have good security.  felt safe.   if visiting the park , this location was exceptional as just a few steps from the enterance and museums."
30,"My friend and I spent one night at Tikal Inn, and overall were a little disappointed given the price.  Positives: - clean, spacious rooms - reasonably comfortable beds - friendly staff, especially at the front desk  Negatives: - we were not warned about the power situation: we only had power from 6am - 8am, and 6pm - 10pm. It was pouring rain so we ended up sitting in a dark, stuffy room for multiple hours. - WiFi did not work the entire time we were there (even though they advertised having WiFi). This was especially challenging as we were trying to confirm our travel plans for the next day and had no means of communication.  Overall, okay hotel, but warn people ahead of time about power and internet outages. It is all about expectations."
40,"I spent two nights at Tikal Inn as I didn't want to be rushed and wanted to do the sunrise tour with Roxxy. The hotel room and amenities were decent, the internet was slow and the electricity went out during night( you need a flashlight). But if you went in with these expectations, you won't be unpleasantly surprised. Overall, I would recommend it for the proximity to the park, but you can't expect luxury in the middle of the jungle."
10,Warning: stay away from this lodge!!  There is a psycho on the loose on the property named Carlos. Because he is the son of the owners of the hotel he acts with impunity. The employees of the hotel have no choice but to tolerate his behavior since they live in fear of loosing their jobs.  He ruined our experience of Tikal.  This is what happened:  As soon as my husband and I arrived at the Jungle Lodge we inquired at the front desk as to their sunrise tour for the next morning. The man at the front desk informed us that we had to pay for the tour in cash. We told him we were short on cash (there is no ATM in Tikal) and that we preferred to charge the tour to our room. He responded that he would see what he could do.   A while later we returned and again inquired if we could pay
40,"We are a couple in our forties with two kids ages 10 and 13.  We stayed here for one night.  We came to Tikal on a tour with Cave's Branch in Belize, then left that tour to stay here at Jungle Lodge on our own.    Our room was nice, two comfortable beds with mosquito nets provided (didn't need them), and a large bathroom.  It was a bit dark (two windows and shaded by trees all around), but we weren't in there much so it didn't really matter.  The staff were not terribly friendly, perhaps because we don't speak Spanish and English seems to be less in use in Guatemala than Belize.  However they were accommodating with our schedule, very willing to serve us a late lunch after our morning tour of Tikal despite being outside the posted hours for the restaurant.  The food was all"
50,"This was my fourth time to Tikal and the Jungle Lodge.  It is a wonderful place to stay, right in the archaeological zone.  An outstanding experience to awake within the park and see the jungle come to life.  The sounds of the jungle in the evening will last in your memory forever.  The Lodge staff are a great help and will do anything to make your stay even better.  The villa units are more than adequate. not plush, but very, very nice.  The restaurant is right there and serves good, tasty portions.  After dinner, sit out on the front patio and enjoy the evening.  "
50,"We stayed here for two nights a couple of days ago and it was perfect for what you need while in Tikal. Rooms were decent size, bathrooms large and clean. Staff here are really friendly and were very helpful when we needed help ringing our transfer company. Both mornings we wernt in for breakfast so they asked if we would like a packed box breakfast which was perfect while up on the ruins for sunset :). Has a pool which was defiantly key as it is very hot during the day! Monkeys play in the trees above as you swim below. Amazing! "
40,"We stayed at Tikal Jungle Lodge June 19th for one night.  The room was comfortable but basic. In the middle of the jungle and inside Tikal  National Park, the location was perfect. We took a sunset walk with a guide through Tikal where we saw and heard monkeys and other animals.  Then took another tour for the next morning. Food was delicious and priced reasonably.  Staff were friendly and accommodating. Bring insect repellent and sunscreen.  "
40,"Pretty decent hotel. Has a pool, which was a bit chilly!  Rooms basic, but clean and comfortable. Food (half board) was included and was pretty good. Also a dawn tour was included.  Had some trouble booking, sending multiple faxes that were never confirmed. In the end I did it using a Internet link to pre-pay with visa.  Downside is that as this is in the middle of the jungle, there was limited power (in the evening and when I was out on the dawn tour), and hot water. Would be nice if they had the hot water and power when people come back from the dawn tour!  Lots of wildlife around, saw fireflies in the evening and other guests saw toucans in the trees.  Contact for the hotel: tikalinn@gmail.com"
40,"You stay in the jungle! steps away from the Mayan Ruins. Price included a room, breakfast, dinner, 1 tour per night, & shuttle. The food was great. We stayed in the Ranchon rooms its not next to the main building but there is a clear path to the room. It was very basic not luxury but clean. We forgot to bring flashlights and rain coats but the hotel was nice to lend it. I recommend doing the sunrise tour and the archaeological day tour its 4-5 hours but you see all the highlights with explanation. There is only electricity & hot water in the morning and evening 6-10.   They have free shuttle from Santa Elena, Flores airport in the morning and in the afternoon for return. It's an hour drive. Best way to communicate is by e-mail."
50,"The wife and I traveled to Guatemala, specifically to crush Tikal, for 24 hrs while we were in Belize. Obvious things first, you are in Guatemala, you will have to commit to not having all the luxuries of home. Good new the hotel takes credit cards, dinner and breakfast are included, and the beer is cheap and delicious.  First up, there is only electricity in the rooms from 6pm-10pm, no worries you shouldn't be in the room anyways. Go to the pool an hang out, or climb through Tikal by lonesome.  Two, there is warm water (possibly hot), it may not last the whole time. This shouldn't matter it is hotter than blazes there, you don't want to take a hot shower. Lukewarm is more than enough. Again use the pool to keep cool.  Third, there may be bugs. Tough, you came to a rainforest,"
50,My sister and I were traveling to Guatamala from Belize by road. We booked in advance so everything would be a breeze upon arrival. Good location to stay right close by the park. I highly recommend the early morning tour/Sunrise to the Tikal Park.
40,"I stayed in the Ranchon room. The room itself is very spartan. Just a bed and a bathroom - nothing else. I paid 60 USD (low season) through a travel agency as the hotel refuses to give me such a price directly and insisted I get a package. There is no wi-fi in my room. The hotel is very well maintained and the gardens are beautiful. It is about 2-3 minutes walk to the parking lot where you can get a bus. It is about 5 minutes walk to the entrance of the park. There are a few small and cheap restaurants near the entrance of the park, if you do not want to eat in the hotel. All in all, for the price I paid, I have no regret staying in this hotel. Lastly, I did not hear too much bird when I woke up in the early morning, as opposed to what other people said."
30,"We just stayed at the Jungle Lodge for our overnight Tikal trip and I was happy to only be there for a day.  The location is extremely convenient and beautiful as you’d expect and it was awesome to watch a large group of howler monkeys while we sat by the pool.  The staff was not very friendly at all unfortunately.  The biggest annoyance was that they only have the power on from about 5PM-11PM (and they didn’t even tell us this when we checked in).  Tikal is hot and the ceiling fan is one of the few things that makes the heat tolerable but it’s shutting off when the power does so it was a long, hot night.  Perhaps even more annoying was that getting up around 4AM is very common so that you can hike out and see the sunrise.  It is harder than you’d think to get ready in the"
30,"We decided to stay at the jungle lodge for two nights this past week mostly because of location convenience as well as the pool. We had a short amount of time so we wanted to make it easy by staying right in the park. What we got was a rather overpriced hotel, with poor communication and no water after a long hot day.   When we first arrived we had a chance to talk to our guide who was in fact awesome & very friendly. Probably the best part of our experience there. We had signed up for both the sunrise & sunset tours. We were told before arriving that all our meals were included but when it came down to it, they only provided us one lunch and one breakfast. I was disappointed to come on this site & see that breakfast was included during your stay.   The night before our hike"
50,"Amazing! I was travelling in a group totalling 12 when we stayed one night at the Jungle Lodge in the middle of the Tikal Forest. It was a splurge but worth it. Our trip's nature guide picked up our group from the Flores Airport and we were transported to the lodge, which is within the national park. We arrived late but the staff reopened the restaurant to feed us. Each of us had a separate cabana style room with 2 double beds and a bathroom/shower. Very clean, very nice. The place has a nice restaurant, a beautiful pool, and is within walking distance of the ruins. When we got up in the morning for our dawn walk, the grass in front of the cabanas was full of coatimundi grubbing for insects, the macaws were busy flying back and forth overhead, and the howler monkeys were"
50,"My niece and are are currently staying in the hostel section of Tikal Jungle lodge.Letty at the reception desk is sweet and efficient. Service in the pleasant dining area is prompt and friendless. Meals are nicely plated.The shower and toilet area is very convenient and immaculate. There is plenty of hot water, hand sops, paper towels and toilet paper etc.across the courtyard is a small pool. As others have mentioned electricity in the hostel area is not 24/7 so the ceiling fan is available only during specified periods.  We like the comfortable lobby for relaxing,checking emails and meeting  fellow travelers.  This is not a busy time since I is rainy season. So expect  strong rain around 1 pm or so A perfect tie for a siesta. My niece took a day tour and a sunrise tour while I"
40,"My boyfriend stayed in the Hostel part of the Lodge and it was a very nice stay. Kinda annoying they didn't mention the power is only on for a few hours.. Meaning no fan on at night which got hot at night, but I guess we should have assumed since they run off generators. Really nice staff and decent food!"
50,"I stayed at Tikal Inn less tan 2 weeks ago, and i still feel lucky that i made that choise. The place is within the Park, what enables to visit it in the early morning (i had the sunshine tour, which i loved, it's breethetaking the waking up of the forrest and the view from the temple). People working there are so helpful and polite, and i will bring the memory of them and their loveliness. The service is good, the place is very clean, and i think they deserve a bigger ""bravo"" as it's not easy to mantein such a place so clean and tidy, considering it's in teh pure forest. I took the transfer service as well, it was perfectly coordinated. Thanks to all of you! PD: and the food was very tasty"
40,"Fantastic location for sunset and sunrise experience in the ruins.  The bungalows are very nice, the pool nice and empty (i had a swim twice spending only one night), beautiful landscape.  The restaurant food is ok, with the awesome waiters, very nice and efficient.  Try their pancakes for breakfast with the special syrup cooked from allspice leaves. This is a must! The internet was limited and weak, but not a major issue.  The electricity in the rooms is provided from 6 to 10 pm. Also not an issue since the sunrise trip starts at 4am.   The hotel organizes the tours to the ruins (walking distance). I had a problem with the entrance fees to the park that I paid to my travel agency and the hotel told me to pay the fees, otherwise I was not able  to enter the ruins (the agency"
40,Bungalow was simple and clean. Most time was spent touring the ruins. Hotel offered breakfast and dinner as well as a free tour each day- we spent 3 nights here. The food was good and the staff accommodating. Limited electricity and internet but this did not cause any discomfort.
40,enjoyed the hotel quite a lot. the staff were nice and helpful. it is out in the jungle and nice. dark as anything which is just so cool. food is fine since we werent expecting gourmet. teh guide from the hotel who took us throught the park was fantastic. transport to and from flores as effecient and good. would recommend staying here.
40,"Great inexpensive place to stay if you are going to the Tikal park! nice grounds with beautiful plants, rooms are small but comfortable, rooms were clean and close to the park entrance. Free wifi and there is also dinning."
40,We just left Tikal today after staying at Jungle Lodge last evening. One point to make -it is completely worth it to stay here if you want to see the ruins. We packaged this trip through Chaa Creek in Belize and everything went very smooth. Flew from belize city to Flores - easy airport -Tikal rep was right on time and drove us the hour to get to the lodge. Jorge is a very good and safe driver. Checked in with Kevin who is very customer service oriented and talked us through the next day's events which included a sunrise tour. Had dinner food was good-not great but exceeded our expectations. Went to bed early as we had a 4am wake up call. Unfortunately right now it is exceedingly hot. Up near 90 degrees Fahrenheit. No a/c in room with ceiling fan and we baked all night. You will
30,"We stayed at the Jungle Lodge Hostel, but I wanted to post here about the Jungle Lodge Sunrise tour they organize. This was crazy chaotic and you have to really be laid back in order to have fun with it. I purchased the tour the day before, at the front counter of the lodge. He told me someone would knock at my door at 4am (which they did) and to meet at the front desk at 4:30. When I did, no one had me down on their list. Which was odd considering my wake up door was on their list. Anyway, they put me with another group but made it seem like they were doing me a favour and it was a really uncomfortable way to start the day. Anyway, our tour guide was fantastic and the walk to the temple was cool. But wear good shoes, bring water and a flashlight. I’m not joking people, those"
30,"There is a Jungle Lodge AND a Jungle Lodge Hostel. It was confusing because they're located on the same property, but the latter is for the...thrifty backpackers! There was a debate between the hostel and the regular cottages but really the difference is the bathrooms I think. For A LOT less, you share bathrooms. And yes, the bathrooms were a bit dodgy and you should really wear bathroom shoes in there or else there is some disease awaiting you, but it was definitely worth the savings. Also, we were there for one night so really, you can tolerate anything for one night.  Rooms were basic, just two twin beds, a shared side table and one shelf to throw your luggage on. The loudness of the insects at night is deafening…I’ve never heard anything like it. Sadly I couldn’t wear"
10,"When we first arrived, there was a couple sitting in the lobby with a distressed look on their faces. Little did we know we would have the same look the next day. The initial tour of the park was good and exciting--Carlos (the owners son) is very knowledgeable. If we would have left after that then it would have been a good overall experience. However, we were booked for the overnight experience. The rooms didn't have a/c. That's my bad for assuming that they would. The rooms did not have good air flow with the windows open so it made for a miserable night. The mattresses had this thin layer of material over it just under the sheet. I know how much I was sweating that night and the thought of having numerous other sweaty bodies on that same mattress with little to no protection"
40,"We enjoyed this hotel.  The rooms were nothing special, but they were clean and comfortable.  The howler monkeys set up quite a loud chorus during the night, and I turned on our video camera to record the very loud sounds.  My husband thought I was crazy, but we enjoy replaying that part of the video now that we are home.  The pool is very nice and clean too, and the food was good."
40,"We stayed here by default as our reservation at Jaguar Inn was messed up an they were no good at tryin to sort it out! We got a better rate here anyway, and other people said the food was better - althought the options are limited and the food is quite average. 4 of s stayed in 2 cabins waaaay out in the woods. Cheaper rates and more wildlife. Pool was nice to relax in after a full day and early morning touring Tikal. Staff were friendly and helpful - they helped us to change our ticket dates to allow entry te next morning (as we planned - but the bus brought us in early so when we bought tickets they were only for the current afternoon! - look into this)."
40,"This was such an unexpected pleasure  after my travel agency messed up my arrival, so I missed 1/2 day at Tikal, including scheduled morning tour of ruins and lunch at hotel. Upon arrival to the Inn I was given options to make up for what I missed. Tour and meal rescheduled to meet my needs!! Great service from the staff throughout my stay. Superb, friendly staff. Clean rooms comfortable bed. No need for the mosquito net I brought along. The highlight of the stay for me was the excellently prepared meals at the restaurant. Generous portions at a reasonable price. Attention to detail by waiters and chef was outstanding. Never once had to ""look for my waiter.""  Awesome fruit drinks.  On my last day, rescheduled tour ended at 2PM with departure to airport at 2:30; staff brought"
40,"Despite the high prices (there are only a few hotels near the national park and they all seem to charge whatever they like, though Hotel Tikal Inn was the least expensive), we chose to stay rather than take a day trip in order to maximise our time in the national park.  The grounds were beautiful and well looked after and the pool was a great place to cool off in the afternoon after a sweaty morning walking around the ruins.  The rooms were spacious and clean enough and I thought it was good that electricity wasn't available all day/night to minimise light pollution at night.  Unfortunately the food was just terrible.  It was like having school dinners and things were undercooked and flavourless.  The sunrise tour was excellent (although we were not impressed at having to get up"
30,"Staff all spoke perfect English. Rooms very clean which is hard in the rain forest. Wildlife abundant right on the property. Steps to tikal.  Remember flashlights.  Electric only 6 to 8 am and 6 to 10 pm    Remember repellant. No bugs in rooms but in jungle. Also will be warm at night   Do sunrise tour. Only way to do tikal is to stay in park   Restaurant is typical tikal, simple but well prepared"
50,"As novice international travelers and not knowing Spanish we were having trouble getting a good price for transportation from Flores to Tikal, once we made contact with Tikal Inn's Flores office they immediately drove over and straightened it out. Thank you Ricardo! Of course the hotel is lovely, they have a beautiful pool, and the location is historically invaluable. "
20,"This hotel is right next to the park entrance and there is wildlife all over the grounds. We were even woken up each morning by howler monkeys.  On the other hand though, the staff were cold, even insulting at times, the room was very basic and very overpriced."
40,"Comfortable hotel in perfect location at park entrance and I think it's a must to stay in one of the few hotels there to see Tikal early morning. Food in the restaurant is good, pool nice, bar closes too early though."
30,"This hotel is very tired with below average bathrooms. The plus is the location. The restaurant was a pleasant surprise as it did not look appealing but the food was good. Our guide, Antonio, was excellent and can be recommended. "
20,"The setting is perfectly located for the Mayan ruins, but that's about the best thing about this place along with all the wild animals who frequent it.  The barstaff don't return change, the food is bizarre, the toilets block constantly and the electricity is off after 9pm.  Worst thing is the way they whack up all costs then had the cheek to put my payment through twice, meaning a long drawn out process for a refund on my credit card."
50,"This is the perfect place to stay in the jungle. We rented one of the units that had a bathroom in the suite with 2 double beds. The swimming pool was exceptional, especially with the hot weather.   Food was good too.  We did a guided tour with Jose Luis Zecena of Tikal.  guideoftikal@gmail.com Jose grew up in the jungle with lots of good stories to tell.   Wifi was okay in the reception area.   We had electricity throughout the night."
30,"Hotel Tikal Inn is a beautiful hotel with good front desk service and restaurant. I gave it a 3 stars due to the price tag. I took a tour package from Antigua and stayed in the hotel rooms which promise hot shower. But the shower is not hot and the ceiling fan is loud when it is being switched on and moves so slow that it hardly functions. It is bad as you are staying in a hot and humid jungle. Plus the electricity only runs from 6pm to 10pm. Although all the hotel room windows are covered with mosquito nets, still you will still get some mosquito or insect bites. The room is really basic so it hardly justify the price paid. The only good thing is the beautiful swimming pool. Maybe this is the reason that you got to fork out more for the room price. The tour to Tikal with the"
50,"My wife and I stayed here for a night on our honeymoon. Service was excellent. The staff spread flower petals throughout the bedroom and bathroom and made our stay feel extra special. We did the sunrise tour and it was one of the highlights of our trip. When the generators are turned off at night, you can really hear the jungle come alive. It was amazing!"
50,My boyfriend and I visited Tikal in July and stayed here and it was a blast. The bungalo was very charming and we enjoyed the spooky howler monkeys early in the morning. We did the sunrise tour with the hotel which is a great way to experience Tikal. Hotel Tikal Inn was beautiful and delightful!
40,"Close to site, nice pool!  Had battery back up light when electric was out.  We had nice clean room and no bugs.  Good shower and food.  Enjoyed this place :)  We were near the pool and did not mind waking at 4 as we were going to the sunrise.  If not doing this, you will be awakened."
40,Epic jungle and the hotel is quirky and just as you would expect in the middle of a huge jungle.  Such a better option to stay in the Park than Flores as you get the amazing experience to stay in the jungle.   Make sure you get the hotel to get Juan to guide you around the park he was the best guide we had during our entire trip in 2 months.
40,"We had our stay booked by a travel agent in Antigua.  It was to include a tour with guide.  When we arrived in the early morning, Carlos, who was supposed to be our guide said his knee was sore and we would leave at 2:30.  We bided our time until then and when we showed up he said he was still sore and had another guide come.  BUT he promised to take us on a sunrise tour at 4:30 the next morning. We got up at 4:00am and went to the front desk and he stood us up.  He sent message that he couldn't go and never showed his face again. We had to pay 150 Q each to get into the park and find our own way.  The food is good but what is ""included"" is some vegetable soup and one option for main course.  No drinks or even water is included.  The staff was friendly (other than Carlos who was"
40,"Could not want for a better location, being able to stroll into the park surrounded by wildlife.  Bungalows well spaced out with private area to sit, the environment of the hotel was very pleasant with mature trees.  Swimming pool though we did not use it. Breakfast was very good, perfectly cooked.  Staff willing and pleasant though inexperienced. Accommodation was clean and comfortable. Good place to stay a couple of nights."
50,"The Jungle Lodge is located within the Park, within easy walking distance to the major ruins. Nice accommodation in bungalows with verandas Very clean and tidy.Mosquito nets, lots of hot water Dining room was a nice surprise Good meals at reasonable prices. Credit to Guatemala .., they have preserved one of the best Mayan ruins in a very natural setting Beautiful landscape with wildlife all around you "
30,"The Jungle lodge is a cabin style ""resort"" close to the entrance of the ruins at Tikal. The place is about an hours drive from Flores airport and is remote.  The individual cabins are relatively spacious, clean and with good beds and a good bathroom but lack air conditioning. There is an old ceiling fan. The windows have mosquito mesh and there is a mosquito net in the room. The place needs a bit of refurbishing. There is no fridge, mini bar or tea making facilities in the room.  The reception and dining area is big and there is a souvenir shop but no snacks or drinks of any description unless you order them on the menu. Reception is so-so and not exactly helpful. The dining room staff are friendly but hint broadly about tips.  Food is expensive and average. The wine and other"
40,We really enjoyed our stay at the Jungle Lodge. We stayed for 3 days but probably should have only done 2. The hotel was nice but there isn't a lot going on in the area. The staff was friendly and helpful and we certainly loved the happy hour at the pool. For the area it's a good choice
40,"The only way to see Tikal at sunrise/sunset is to stay at a hotel in the park.  With limited choices and amenities Hotel Tikal Inn is perfectly acceptable.  Power is limited (most of time you will have no electricity in your room), wifi is sporadic and weak...both of which are not a problem if you know going in.  The benefits are that you will be in the park when it is not crowded and during the cooler parts of the day.  Front desk staff needs a little hospitality training, the restaurant staff was excellent.  Food is above average and the grounds are very nice.  Rooms are large and all that you will need.  NOTE:  They will convert quetzales to US dollars before charging your credit card.  Not the best way to do it, but overall not a big deal, just be prepared.    Hotel also had"
50,"While submitting our payment via the Visa website provided by the hotel we made reservations with, we accidently selected Tikal Inn as the payee.   Upon realizing our error, we immediately contacted Tikal Inn and explained our situation.  They were quick to respond and had their manager engage the Visa payment center to work a refund.  Though it took a bit of time to sort things out, we finally received our refund.  The hotel could have simply left things as is, and we’d be out $400 USD; but they didn’t.  There were professional through and through and worked closely with us to resolve the issue.  Though we didn’t stay at this hotel, we did have a chance to see it when we visited and must say it’s a very nice hotel by all accounts, with friendly staff and a nice in-ground pool"
50,"This was much better than I thought it was going to be!  The quirks are easy to adjust to - electricity only a few hours a day and a short menu in the restaurant - and are more than made up for by the relaxing atmosphere, perfectly adequate chalet rooms, excellent pool, and the chance to get out into Tikal before dawn without a cab ride.  We included the pre-dawn morning tour and evening meal in our booking.  Excellent value and terrific guide too.  100% recommended."
40,"The location is perfect, right in the middle of the jungle and within easy walking distance of the ruins.  While not 5 star, it's surprisingly luxurious given just how remote the location is and very well maintained.  The pool is excellent, the food was quite tasty, beautiful grounds, and I found the staff to be polite and engaging.  The price is admittedly quite high for Guatemala, but I still think it's a good value for what you get, especially when you factor in free dinner, free breakfast, and a free sunrise tour by a very knowledgeable guide (thanks, Eddie!). The bottom line is when you're an hour away from anything and have access to a full staff, pool, lodging, etc., I don't understand why other reviewers expect to find $10 hostel prices.  It doesn't work that way in the"
40,"Nice jungle hotel, try the package deal room and food and the sunrise tour, very dated but clean, food was very good try the fish dinner, overall nice if you consider being in the middle of the jungle not a 5 star resort but nice experience for us coming from cancun to visit TIKAL and working our way back thru belize ."
30,Obviously a great location. Bathrooms nice and big but rooms basic. Wifi barely works and definatly not in your room. Be prepared for bugs. Food great and service was fine. And be prepared for electricity shut downs
20,"The toilet didn't flush well, trickle of hot water in the sink, shower head was rusted, pool chairs collapsed on 2 guests including my wife.  In the dining room,  the staff did not speak more than a smattering of English. We spent one night,  which was one too many.  The Tikal Mayan ruins are extremely interesting, and well worth visiting.   The Jungle Lodge is not!"
30,"Our stay wasn't the greatest - there were lots of problems from the beginning.    While we were checking in, another guest came up to the reception - she had just checked in, and when she want to the room, she found someone else's bags already there.  They quickly gave her a different room, but it made me uncomfortable.  The toilet in our room would not stop running.  They fixed it, and it was fine until our last day, when it happened again.  I also found a wad of toilet paper in the bed the first night.  The restaurant had laid out dirty napkins - soup stains all over them.  (Obviously hadn't been washed)  They replaced the ones at our table quickly, but it left me feeling a little disgusted.  The service at the restaurant was hot and cold - most of the staff were really"
30,This comfortable but basic lodge is convenient for easy entrance to the ruins. Waking to Howler monkeys is awesome as is the bird life. The staff were friendly but speaking some Spanish was useful.  The food was hot and plentiful but a little repetitive and not typical of the country. A bit more imagination would be good.  I would certainly stay here again
30,"This is close to the entrance to the Tikal Park and thus is convenient.  It is totally lacking in charm.  Rooms are OK, and staff was polite, but I think there are probably better places to stay.  There was no wifi in rooms and not much in the lodge.  The food was OK."
30,"Tikal the park is amazing so please don't let this review influence a visit to the park itself.  That said, we were pretty disappointed with our stay at Tikal Inn; not for many of the reasons mentioned in other reviews however. By the time you make your reservation you should know that it's in the middle of nowhere, Jurassic Park style, no a/c, no power for majority of the day, etc. so we find it odd when people complain about those things.  What made the stay bad for us were service and customer relation things which could be corrected. We felt as if they did not care if we had a bad experience because another bad review wouldn't change the fact that tourists will always come to see Tikal and always fill up the hotel. I do believe the receptionist was doing his best to"
40,"For a hotel in the jungle this is pretty good. Its not great, but its the jungle and its Guatemala. Its clean and safe and well priced. I got the package deal - room and food and morning tour.   The grounds of the hotel are beautiful. The lobby and dining room are not amazing, very dated but fine just the same. The pool area looked nice.   The bedroom is huge and the bathroom is big. The smell from the bathroom is not great but thats how it is in Guatemala generally and especially in the jungle.   I was somewhat concerned about bugs before I got there but it was fine. The room has screening in the open spaces which felt sufficient to me while still allowing airflow.  I was completely comfortable in my room. Yes it was hot, of course it was hot! And the cut off of the generator"
20,"While staying here, I felt that Hotel Tikal Inn is only after your money and doesn't care at all about your satisfaction. They use their great location to their advantage and charge you for everything imaginable that is normally guaranteed at any other hotel (ex. we were charged for water and our dinner that came with our package deal didn't even include a single non-alcoholic beverage).   If you are planning on doing the sunrise tour, make sure you plan to stay in the park the whole day following the tour. Rules have changed and you CAN'T use your ticket from the day before to get into the park for your tour as promised.  Bottom line: LOTS of hidden costs and you could spend the same amount of money and stay at a really nice place in Flores, even considering transport to and"
20,"I am going to describe the hotel as I see it. You judge for yourself. The hotel is on a genarator. Lights are cut off between 8 to 10AM then from 3 to  6Pm and then from 10pm to 6Am. Which means, no fans, no a/c . If the heat doesn't bother you, you will sleep in a sauna...a few extra calories lost awhile you sleep. Can't open the doors, for, the mosquitos will eat you alive...well, after all, we are in the jungle...The food included in the package, breakfast and dinner, also. Minimalist....there goes another few pounds off. Quality wise, very basic. I ate the fish, even though, it was frozen, the ones that come breaded in a frozen package... It wasn't too bad.... Or perhaps I was very humgry, with vegetables. Drinks are apart. Breakfast, 2 eggs, beans, 3 slices of fruit, coffee"
20,"What a shame, the National Park is neglected big time. UNESCO should take a good look at it. The entrance gate  for the park is 17km away. Once you get the the main area where the hotels are, it looks shabby, run down, unattended and poorly maintained. Copan in Honduras Is way better in a very smaller scale though. The hotel is wiin the park. The rooms are basic. Electicity is by a generator, 6am-8Am than back at 10 to 1Pm and again between  6pm to 10pm.Internet  Is terribly slow. Stayed for two nights. Should have done one night only. I guess, Tikal is a one day tour."
30,"Jungle Lodge has a monopoly location in the Tikal archaeological area and that may account for its less-than-perfect aspects.  The hotel is very picturesque from the outside, and the lobby/lounge is attractive and spacious.  However, the individual rooms are meager in amenities.  No a/c, which is OK during the dry season we are in at present.  No individual safe, which is not OK unless you are only there overnight.  The wifi in the lobby was very slow.  The wifi in our room turned out to have a different password, and it was not worth it to trek back to the lobby to ask for it, since we were leaving early the next morning.  The room was sparsely furnished with poor lighting, no chair and no decoration that I can remember.  It was fine for a night's sleep, but not for any other"
50,"Absolutely perfect location from which to visit the ruins at Tikal, as you can walk from your room to the site. The grounds are set in the middle of the jungle and you can float around in the pool whilst watching the spider and howler monkeys cavorting in the tree tops. The bar and restaurant are both well stocked with food and drink and the staff are well trained, friendly and chatty and, speak some English. We all really enjoyed our stay here and would happily visit again."
40,"Great place to stay and explore Tikal.  Although it was raining when we arrived we quickly were register, given room keys and shown to our accommodation, 9B.  Great soup for supper, retired to our room listening to the night noises.  We were awakes to the sound of howler monkeys and squawking brown jays.  After breakfast we had a lovely, easy hike through the ruins, interesting trails, nice variety of birds and back for a late lunch.  Staff at the hotel were very helpful, good sense of humour and nice surroundings for relaxing in the afternoon."
40,"When you've reached Jungle Lodge you are already deep into the geography of Tikal National Park. To stay in the Park is part of the Tikal experience in my opinion and this is the second time we are doing it.  We registered and went to our accommodation, 12B, overlooking a grove of forest, birds chirping in the late afternoon, rays of sun piercing the forest canopy, two double beds,large ceiling fan,and I observed the hoop of mosquito netting draped above my bed although there are screens on the windows.  Warm shower, dinner in the Lodge, some Chilean wine and finally the sounds of crickets, the occasional roar from a howler monkey as the sun disappeared below the horizon. Life in the jungle was relevant as I hunkered down for the night in relatively luxurious surroundings"
40,"I was a little worried by the negative reviews on this site, but we found this to be a great place to stay at Tikal. It has some ""luxury"" features (towels made into swans on the bed when we returned) and some that were not - you could see right through to the next bathroom via the drainpipe. However, overall, we thought this was a lovely place to stay - nice grounds, nice staff. Watch for the agoutis that graze in the middle garden and of course the ubiquitous keel-billed toucans and red-lored parrots.  If you are short on time be sure to get in as soon as possible - sunrise is worth it, and so is sunset, and if you arrive late in the day (note there are no collectivos after noon or so), try to time it so that you can get entrance into the park for the next day as well - after"
50,"This is right by the gates to the Ancient Mayan city, deep in the National Park. But it is a fully functioning excellent hotel. The pool side bungalows are huge, super clean and tidy and really well equipped with a good bathroom. They are also very well sealed against bugs.   You are in the national park: seeing the same stars as Ancient Mayans, surrounded by wildlife like turkeys and toucans, ready for the sunrise tour to Temple 4, and the archaeological tour at 9.30 with the guy from Flores. Miss neither. The guide at 9.30 was particularly amazing, and gave an incredible tour, layered with knowledge of all things Maya.   The food is EXCELLENT. Try the beef. The staff were brilliant too, especially Edgar on the front desk.  Bear in mind that because you are in the national"
40,"Staff is helpful. If you want to get a map of the park, they don't give it away as in USA - get ready to shell out some quatzemalas- the hotel staff sell it and tourist center at the park, not expensive though. The place is located in the woods - in the morning you can talk to monkey jumping around your cabin. We stayed in the cabin away from pool and facing the forest. Food is OK, nothing great. We did not take sunset or sunrise tours - can't comment on that. We prefer do everything on our own and we did not regret. Everything you do with tour guide, you can do it yourself if you are willing to and have some experience. Agree with other reviewers that wi-fi is really weak but that is an issue with all over guatemala, at least where we stayed. We stayed two nights and  the power"
30,"We chose a jungle side bungalow with the meals and tours included. $110 per night. The bungalow is nice, spacious and clean, but our sheets were very damp and we weren't able to look out the windows into the jungle! All the windows are at shoulder height, so it makes the bungalow feel a bit like a cave. The mosquitos and flies basically make it impossible to sit on the terrace. I would recommend taking a pool side bungalow instead.  Staff is very friendly and try very hard to help you. However, this didn't help us much when they didn't organise the promised airport pickup from Flores - even though the $60 (!) for the private transfer was already included in the bill. Thankfully, a friendly cabdriver at the airport agreed to take us and sort his payment out with the hotel. "
40,"If you are looking for a hotel inside the park, this is perfect! It's a no frills faciltiy with some rooms having wonderful amenities (e.g. bathoom, shower, fans) but if you are looking for a place to stay for a day or two to visit the ruins, this is a good place to be!"
40,"Hotel Tikal Inn was a beautiful choice for our family trip.  The staff is gracious and eager to help with what ever you desire.  The only reason that I gave it a 4 was because the Wi-Fi was very weak.  We had to crowd into one corner of the reception area to receive service. Also, one morning the power did not come on until 630. This is a problem when you are trying to charge a phone or need to make a phone call before you start a tour. The only other negative experience was at the beginning the reception desk staff was very confused as to what we wanted even though I am fluent in Spanish.  I am not sure if the girl was new or if they really do not have moonlight tours in Tikal but every time I expressed an interest in a moonlight tour, the receptionist told me about the sunrise"
20,"This hotel is very basic, tired-looking, and definitely screaming out for renovation.  Originally built to house archaeologists working in the National Park, the individual bungalows are of a utilitarian style providing few comforts.  Upon arrival we were shown to a bungalow which had no electricity; we asked for another room and were grudgingly moved.  Our relief at having electricity in the second room soon evaporated when we discovered there was no water!  When we trudged back to the reception to alert the young man on duty, he said he knew there was no water but ""They're working on it"".  Some time later, the water was reconnected.  We received cheerful service from the waitress at dinner and the food, although not great, was acceptable.  Lighting throughout the grounds was"
30,"What a disappointment!  Our room was tawdry and very basic, with overused sheets and bedding which did not look too clean.  The bathroom was an equal disappointment.  We were glad we were only booked in for one night.  The staff was not particularly friendly or helpful.  One waiter asked for a tip before we had even finished our dinner.  The food was acceptable and no more.  On checking out, paying with a mixture of Quetzals and US Dollars, the guy on reception asked for $20 more than I had worked out.  I was able to spot the ‘error’ and get my money back before we left.  The hotel is right at the entrance to Tikal, which appears to be its main attraction and, I think, the hotel plays on this too much rather than provide an excellent experience for its customers.  We met people"
40,"This is a good hotel in the middle of the mayan reserve. It's worth staying so close so you don't waste to much time getting to the real business of the area, even more if you consider that Guatemala is not such an organized place. This being said, the hotel is a very calm place to stay with some wild life close to you (specially spider monkeys and birds). The shower, though, is as terrible as you can imagine in the middle of the jungle. The rest is quite all right: pool is good and relaxing and the food is very good at dinner."
50,"We stayed there 3 nights this month - January Very impressed indeed Comfortable room and attentive staff Food is great  The swimming pool is inviting and spotlessly clean We saw spider monkeys from our small private terrace overlooking pristine forest  The site is very special - adjoins the Tikal ruins site  On a morning walk from the hotel - early - 6ish - we saw woodpeckers , endangered oscillated turkeys , spider and howler monkeys , a grey fox and innumerable other magnificent birds  - then walked into the splendour that is Tikal for the day   Thoroughly recommended"
20,"This hotel probably has one of the best locations in the world, however, it's far away from matching it's surroundings.  We booked thru booking.com and stayed for 4 days in early December 2014, we could not believe our eyes when we were back in college, being assigned a tiny room with a bathroom that's shared with other hotel guests, hotel staff and any other lost tourist waiting for the tour guide to show up, we found no information that detailed this while booking. These rooms cost $40 USD / There are other rooms that are double in size and have their own bathroom and cost $100 USD; an upgrade was never offered. Bedsheets and decor have been overlooked for a couple of decades.  Food was great.  Staff is not the friendliest, I had a hard time finding 1 smile from anyone except"
40,"If you're doing a Sunset/Sunrise tour of Tikal, which I highly recommend, you'll want to stay in the park itself.  The Tikal Inn was a great option for staying inside Tikal. It was a good value  (around $150US including dinner/breakfast/tour). I also arranged transport from San Ignacio, Belize through the hotel at about half the rate I'd been quoted elsewhere ($35US per person). The rooms were clean. The food at the restaurant was good. The staff was very friendly and helpful. And during the middle of the day you'll be very thankful they've got a swimming pool!  The only drawback was the power situation - since they run on generators you only have power during limited hours."
50,"It was an experience from Lion King.  Roxy, Tikal Inn's  anthropologist resident, definitely is a highlight.  She took a small group of us to the Mayan ruins at 4am.  Flashlight in hand, we were led through the jungle listening to all the magical sounds.  Finally at our highest peak, the rainforest below us, morning mist rolling in and the famous Mayan ruins below us I felt we were part of the Lion King production.  When we returned at 8am, breakfast at the Inn was a gourmet.  Our room on the pool was lovely.  Plenty of room to lay out clothes and flashlights for morning tours, Their famous blackout at 10pm was very adventurous.  I think we need to think about this idea for conserving energy in the states.  Our experience was a very bonding with all the visitors.  Roxy's nephew,"
40,"After much research we decided to stay at this hotel in Tikal park based on the reviews, proximity, links with the park and Flores, transport etc....  A great hotel and jungle experience overall. The tropical storm and frog chorus in the evening was brilliant which is what it is all about!   We are on our honeymoon the only negative things I would say is that the food is not good. Believe me I am not fussy! For the price also, I would expect better food. The kitchen staff did or appear do be that concerned or enthusiastic. This review is based on our visit and are therefore not expecting all travellers to agree as we are unsure of the consistency having stayed here for the first time, but we are well travelled and eat local food. We have heard that the food is better at Jaguar"
50,"The Tikal Inn was the perfect place for my son and I.  I was hesitant because of the cost,  $115 the most expensive aspect of our trip, but it was well worth it.  Just the fact that we were on park grounds and didn't have to worry about shuttles to the park was huge.  After exploring the park in the morning with Roxy Ortiz, we ran back at the end of the day to see the sunset.  For the sunrise tour, I didn't have to add an hour just to get there.  We rolled out of bed at 4:30 and hiked up to Temple IV.   Afterwards, we had breakfast and chilled at the pool.  The rooms was adorable and we stayed in a cabana around the pool.  The staff was very accommodating and gave us a modem for our room, since we could connect to wi-fi in the lobby.    The electricity blackout is a bit weird,"
40,Loved that the place went dark it was like camping in a nice room. It was so wonderful to hear the jungle around us. The food was excellent and so was the staff. It was like eating with family everyday we were there. The pool was very nice very refreshing in the middle of the jungle. If you go to Tikal it is the place to stay at night they had a group of people playing music I slept so good there I want to go back someday very soon.  Plus our guide from Four Directions in Guatemala recommended this wonderful place for us.
50,"If you want to visit the magnificent Mayan ruins of Tikal, this is the No.1 place to stay. The Jungle Lodge is the closest accommodation to the site and located right inside the national park – we woke up to howler monkeys hanging in the trees right outside our lodge (don't be alarmed by their loud roars in the night) and even caught sight of a Pizote! And if you're worried about bugs, the beds come with proper mozzie nets. The shower could have had a little more power but, hey, it's in the jungle after all! The restaurant staff weren't overly friendly, but that may have been due to the language barrier – they certainly weren't rude. And we couldn't fault the amazing hospitality of the wonderful Carlos, who will greet you with a giant smile and what he calls a 'hand hug' as you"
30,"This is an ideal location to stay if you want to go to Tikal, especially at sunrise. They will arrange a guide for you, which I personally recommend unless you don't mind walking through the park in the pitch dark. You will need to pay for the tickets to the park as you arrive at the edge of it- and the hotel is well within the park. The accommodations were average, nothing exceptional yet nothing awful. There was a mosquito net around the bed; however, we didn't find the need to use it."
50,"After having read some pretty scathing reviews on TripAdvisor about the attitude of the restaurant staff here, we were leery about eating here but I am happy to say that they must have totally changed the staff because our experience during four meals at Jungle Lodge was the exact opposite.  The staff were all delightful, the food was presented promptly and was generally excellent and reasonably priced. We did change from our reserved twin room with no bathroom to a (much) more expensive bungalow but considered the splurge worth it after seven days rafting and camping on sandy beaches, sometimes in the rain.  I had paid cash for the original room but the desk clerk kindly suggested that he refund the cash to me and that I charge the new room (2 nights) to conserve quetzales.  "
30,"If you want to visit Tikal, this is probably the place to stay. It is right in the national park and only a short walk away from the ruins themselves meaning that you can get there early, or even watch the sun rise from the top of the temple. The hotel itself is in attractive landscaped grounds, but is all slightly in need of tlc and a good clean! With a small amount of time and money it could be really nice. The walls are quite thin. Our children in the next door room said they could hear every word! There is also quite a lot of jungle noise at night, especially the howler monkeys, but that is part of the appeal. Service a bit hit and miss. There was quite a lot of confusion about what was included in our room, and they tried to charge us for dinner even though we had already"
40,"We flew into Florres from Belize City and on my request the hotel arranged a transfer from the airport for a fee. The hotel is approx 1 hour away from Florres airport and you have to pay the entrance fee to Tikal separately. Make sure you have some Guatemalian currency as, on our drivers advice we got some US dollars changed at the airport.  We arrived into the hotel in darkness but the ambience looked lovely with all the lights throughout. We booked one of the bungalows and it was easy to get to in the dark as there are lights along the path. The room was large with 2 double beds and lots of room to put your luggage. Both beds were comfortable and had mosquito nets which we used and we had no issues with bites. The bathroom was a bit smaller with basic toiletries.  We ate in"
40,"We stayed just one night on their package which includes food and sunrise tours. Although the room was basic, it was large and clean and exactly what we expected having read other reviews. Our kids loved the pool and spent a lot of time in it. We did not regret our choice of place to stay as it was definitely an advantage to stay inside the park and walk leisurely to Tikal at our convenience, rather than have to ride over an hour from Flores. Unlike a previous reviewer we recommend taking the overnight bus if you want to save money. For four of us, it is about 1/4 the price of a flight, so resulted in considerable savings. All our seats were the most comfortable we have had on a bus, and reclined more than most, so we arrived refreshed having had a reasonable nights sleep. We"
50,"It may look like on the expensive side for Guatemala but if you take into account that a breakfast/lunch and a tour are included it's really not that expensive. The pool is great if you want to take a break between Tikal explorations. I loved that they turn of the lights at 10pm, otherwise i would not be able to see such a gorgeous night sky."
40,"Upon arriving at the Flores Airport, we were greeted by the driver for the Hotel Tikal Inn, who took us on a very leisurely drive to the Hotel.  One snafu occurred, as we were told by the Hotel that US funds would be accepted at the entrance to the Park, they weren't.  After some dickering, the gate keeper and his cohorts agreed to exchange our US for Guat money.  Off to the hotel we went.  Arriving, we checked in and were charmed by the thatched bungalows.  Of course there is no electricity twice per 24 hrs, so no AC, and it can be quite stifling during the very hot months, some of us slept better than others. The service is excellent, food is pretty good.  Prices are up there, but after all you are staying in the jungle, and there are few alternatives if you choose to stay"
50,"This hotel is located inside Tikal, and as such, doesn't have A/C or power to the rooms.  You get power (and hot water) in the morning (6-9) and evening (6-10).  The rooms are clean and basic (bed, bathroom, fan, light).  The grounds are beautiful with a nice pool.  The food was very good, though basic.  What really stands out is the exceptional customer service.  Great communication before and during my visit, and they arranged for my airport pick up and return.  If you want to stay in the park, this is definitely the place.  You're paying for location, so you give up some of the amenities of staying in Flores, but its well worth it to be so close to Tikal."
40,"The ground was well kept, room and pool very clean. It was a simple place but you really can't ask for too much considering the location (in the middle of the jungle). Food was OK, the chicken enchilada is the best on their menu, better than the ""real entrees"". If you really want AC, you can go to other hotels nearby during high noon :)  We got the sunrise package and a garden bungalow, the reservation was easy, I had a lot of questions and called their 1800 numbers multiple times(more than just Tikal, but other regions as well), they were very paitent and very hepful, they even went out of their way to buy bus tickets for us!  We took the sunset tour with them, the guide apparentky was not their usual guide and was not as knowledgable/entertaining as expected, however they did"
50,"We stayed at this hotel at the suggestion from a  great friend. On arrival we were greeted by staff and felt welcomed as if we were coming home. The hotel was undergoing renovations which I must say are impressive. The hotel is conveniently located at the entrance of the park, in tune with its environment. Electricity to the rooms its available at certain times of the day as they are trying to be green an ecologically conscious which we appreciate and respect. The staff was courteous and attentive to our needs and the tour guide assigned to us with Carlos Ortiz aka Calo for the Sunrise tour was knowledgeable and beyond our expectations. The food and the service was one of the best in our stay in Guatemala and if your are looking for a killer Michelada I will highly recommend the"
40,"We found the Jungle Lodge to be much nicer than the Jaguar Inn.  We did not take a look at the Tikal Inn which as a little bit down the road from the other two so can’t say how the Jungle Lodge compares there.  Both the Jungle Lodge and Jaguar Inn are inside Tikal National Park and very near the visitor center and parking area for people who drive in.     The Jungle Lodge was established when the University of Pennsylvania archaeological dig was shutting down.  During the dig, it was the site of a tent city where the workers and archaeologists stayed. Once they left, some of the team were granted permission to take over the tent city to run as a hotel for tourists who had started coming.  The lodge has stayed under the ownership of this original family ever since.  Along the way"
40,"The location is perfect especially if you are doing a sunrise tour. Our room was large and the bed comfortable, the linens were also of a good quality and the mosquito net in tact! The room was very clean and cleaned each day. We were on a B&B rate and breakfast was great. I found the food better than expectations (based on reviews seen).  The negatives were slow service in the restaurant, despite there were just 2 covers and no in room safe. Overall perfect for what it was needed for."
30,Great location to Tikal.  Rooms were poorly lit.  It was difficult to see in the evening.  There were a couple US type electrical outlets in the room but they were two prong only.  So if you had a computer with a grounded (three prong plug) you were out of luck.  Lots of birds and the occasional monkey around the hotel.
40,We stayed one night at the lodge in one of the hostel rooms.  It was very basic and perfect for us to sleep and go explore Tikal.   I would use caution if arriving into Flores after 6:00 pm.  The only transportation out to the lodge at Tikal was a taxi for $60 US.  That was a bit of a shock on a backpackers budget.
30,"As the only price conscious hotel within Tikal park, this was the logical choice of stay for mine and my boyfriends student budgets.  For $20 each their shuttle came to pick us up in Flores where our bus from Belize City dropped us. This was worth the $20, saving us the effort of having to figure out another way there when we were on such a tight time constraint. Our driver even stopped and helped save a little turtle crossing the road.  Reception was incredibly helpful in arranging transportation back for us the next day too. They also stored our bags for us when we had to check out before we were ready to leave the park.  The room - it was okay. We stayed in a room in the main building. Very hot, very humid. We only had power from 6pm to 10pm, so only having a ceiling fan on"
40,We stayed in one of the bungalows near the pool and liked it very much.  We were on the meal plan with breakfast and dinner included.  The food was good even though the selections were limited.  The location of the Inn within the park is a real plus.  It is still a good walk into the area where the ruins are located but much better than a long ride from town.  The staff is friendly and they maintain the property well.  The use of the pool in the afternoon and evenings helps to offset the heat and humidity.  We took the sunset tour into the park and found it to be interesting.
10,"We were really looking forward to our stay at the tikal inn. But this excitement was soon stopped. We came by nightbus from Antigua to Flores, arriving early in the morning. Of course we told the hotel our app arravialtime. But well, they missed it to tell us that we had to pay a 20US$ p.p. Entrance fee for the park to get to the hotel. Only valid for one day! At the ticket office they told us, we had to wait until 3.30 pm to purchase a ticket for the next day. So we were forced to visit the park at noon after a 15 hour bus trip!  Furthermore after arriving to the hotel we discovered how ""basic"" our room really was. For 111 US$ you get hot water and electricity only during some hours of the day and a more or less clean room furnished with only a bed. Our privat bathroom was tiny"
40,"The bungalow was good(what can you expect in the jungle),property is well looking cared with.Staf friendly, they even where flexibel because changed the booking last minute. thank you for the effort! It was easy to have to food in the hotel itself. Food was good enought for us. Swimmingpool is nice in the afternoon when it gets hot! We spotted some coatsmundis in the garden and also some monkeys."
50,"A great place to begin my visit in Guatemala. If you factor in the free breakfast, dinner AND early morning tour included with a one night stay, I believe this hotel is a good value stay. Needless to say that the location couldn't be any better. The only disclaimer is that there is a strict lights out at 10 p.m. Personally I thought this was kind of cool as it forced me to wake up at 3:30 a.m. to do the early morning tour and see the sunrise from the tallest tower in Tikal.  I recommend a one night stay here and also staying in Flores for a day.  The service was excellent. The inn also has a restaurant in Flores if you need to drop off your bags and explore the town before catching your plane or bus.  "
30,"I am not one to write many reviews, but this one I can't bring myself to leave alone. A friend and I stayed at the Jungle Lodge in Tikal a few days ago, and the experience could have been superb.... the rooms are nice and clean, the pool is a wonderful little oasis for relaxing, the location is amazing (right at the park entrance), and the property is beautiful.  Unfortunately there is one detail that this hotel leaves you begging for, which ruined the stay for us: THE SERVICE!!!!  It is absolutely horrible - like, makes you uncomfortable during your stay horrible. The centerpiece of this is the waitstaff in the restaurant (which you depend on because there is not a lot of food to be found inside the park), in which one or two waiters are downright RUDE and should be working as"
40,"We stayed in the hotel for two nights so we would be close to Tikal.  There was much to enjoy. The pool is beautiful and was a pleasure when we needed to cool down after walking around in the heat and humidity of Tikal. The staff at the front desk were polite and accomodating and when we asked for breakfast-to-go the first morning, because we were doing the sunrise tour, it was not a problem. Nicely packaged in a portable container with a sandwich, juice, fruit, an egg and more. The following morning we also asked for breakfast- to-go but with specifics foods, again not a problem. The restaurant is spacious with a traditional thatched roof and hardwood furniture and the staff were happy and pleasant. All meals were generous and delicious and, of course, the service was"
40,"We stayed in this hotel last week for 2 nights with friends. The airport shuttle worked perfectly. The hotel was extremely clean and service oriented. We had electricity our entire stay (and had several late nights/early mornings). Overall, it exceeded our expectations. The food is not good but I had expected that from reading other reviews. Given their location, I'm sure they are doing the best they can. The experience of staying in the jungle, waking up to howler monkeys, etc was worth it. The only thing that was an issue for us was construction going on in the unit attached to our room. The hotel seemed fairly empty while we were there. They put us and our friends in rooms with one vacant room between us. The vacant room was under construction and made it extremely hard to"
30,"We did an extensive afternoon tour, spent New Years Eve at the lodge and re-entered the park, ridiculously early (separate guide and admission fee) to greet the New Year's dawn atop the great temple. My daughter's idea actually.  Epic.    Ok, the New Year's dawn was a bit cloudy and misty but an awesome experience just the same.  In total there were about 30 others in the park and atop the temple with us, compared to the many hundreds during the day.  So if you stay here, be sure to do the a sunrise tour. The sounds of the jungle canopy coming to life was awesome.  Following the dawn we toured the site with our guide.  I could tour that site another hundred times.  To me, Tikal makes all the major Mayan sites I've seen look like truck stops by the side of the road.  The Hotel: "
30,"We stayed here 2 nights, and although the Jungle Lodge is in a great location and the grounds were beautiful, I would not want to return here.  What I did like about this place was that it was right next to Tikal, very close... but the other hotels aren't that much farther away. The grounds were beautiful, there were toucans and monkeys in the trees above the rooms, and I loved swimming in the pool and cooling off after walking around in the hot jungle. The room was basic & clean, and the shared bathrooms were surprisingly very clean. What I did not like was the customer service, or lack thereof. And I constantly felt like I was getting ripped off; no where else on my trip did I feel like this. The restaurant food & service was terrible, I'd suggest walking to the other hotels"
50,"Tikal Inn was perfectly placed for spending as much time as possible in Tikal Park, which is an incredible experience. We didn't get to swim because the weather wasn't very hot, but the pool looked nice. Staff were helpful when my husband was sick, and let us stay a little longer in the room. We enjoyed the informative videos in the lobby. A highlight for us was seeing a troupe of coatimindi, flock of occelated turkeys and pair of agouti outside our room - all at the same time! The electricity goes of at night, but this adds to the adventure."
40,"I stayed two nights there and enjoyed it very much. The rooms are big and comfortable. I unfortunately had a huge ant problem and asked to move my room, which they did immediately. We took the breakfast and dinner there. Breakfast was much better, dinner was pretty mediocre. Very nice staff. One complaint is there shuttle to Flores airport is limited; so you're only option is a private van whch goes for $60.00. Know that going in if you can't make the scheduled times of the shuttle van. They have a pool, which is great after a very hot, humid day in the jungles of Tikal. Also, the electricity is only on certain hours-from 6am-8a.m; and then I believe 6-10 p.m. They run tours to Tikal and other sites, but we used Roxy Ortiz who I had read about on Trip Adviser. She is an"
50,"I wanted to get the full experience an spend the night in the jungle. This place is very remote, electricity is only on for a few hours each day and at night it it pitch black.  I chose a bungalow but you can also camp out in a tent...sure it's safe.  They have a pool and are within walking distance to the park. Lots of roaming wildlife, I saw spider monkeys, turkeys with blue heads and something that was related to the raccoon.  All the animals are protected here and are not afraid of humans, but don't get too close.  If you are looking to explore the park before the busses of tourists arrive...this is the way to go!"
40,"I stayed one night and my friend stayed 2 here. Bungalows are large, comfortable and clean. My friend's bathroom was infested with ants and they changed her room with no hassle. Restaurant is good and convenient. Staff is friendly and helpful.  Arranged transport to and from there from Flores. Roxy Ortiz gives fantastic tours here.  She is an archeologist and knows vast amount of history about the site as well as the wildlife there. Pool is nice to have too when you have spent the day in the jungle."
40,"In 2010 we did the usual one night stay at Tikal Inn with sunrise tour, and loved it.  This year we decided to stay 3 nights - arriving late on a Wednesday evening and departing Saturday morning.  It seemed from reviews that travelers rarely do this, so I was wondering how it would be.  Here is my assessment: I still love the hotel.  It has a genuine exotic ambiance, a great pool, and a very friendly staff.   Some things to consider for a longer stay:  I hate to say it, but the food is really not so good - a little hard to stomach by the third evening.  But the hotel has wonderful fresh fruit, and the waiter was happy to bring me a large plate of fruit for dinner my third evening, which was much appreciated. During this particular time of year the rooms are just going to be damp"
40,"Great location Tidy rooms and Bathroom and a nice pool. The owner Carlos was great too. Enjoyed watching the howler monkeys in the trees around the hotel from the comfort of the pool with a beer.The only let down was the restaurant, it tries to do modern European cuisine and misses the mark, should just prepare great local food. The waiters could be a little more friendly too, might have just been our one."
40,"The lodge is perfectly located for easy access to the Tikal site, rooms are clean and spacious. We stayed for 2 nights and meals were included in our package but not drinks ( not even water) the dining area is centrally located and you can watch the wildlife whilst you eat. Food is good and our thanks to Kevin, Lester and Alex for looking after us so well. The swimming pool is a welcome escape from the jungle heat."
40,"Loved our stay here. You are right in the middle of the jungle, right next door to Tikal. Absolutely magical. We stayed in the room and shared the public bathrooms. I was pleasantly surprised for how clean and comfortable it is, considering it's in the jungle. Very comfortable. The pool is so nice and we saw two species of toucans and spider monkeys right from the pool area!  We ate lunch and dinner there and the food was great too. The staff are helpful and attentive, and we were lucky to find that one staff member spoke very good English and could help us with our requests. The staff also booked us a sunrise tour at Tikal and zip Iining over the forest canopy, with pick ups from the hotel. The staff were also happy to exchange money for us.  Downsides - we picked dinner from"
50,"We stayed in a private room with a shared bathroom. Ask for this room by phone because we did not see it advertised and was $45 which was cheaper than any rooms advertised online. The bathroom was always clean and not far from the room. If you are looking for this price point, then I would recommend this hotel as it is the closest one to the entrance to the park. This is especially helpful for the sunrise hike. The wifi worked fine in the lobby, restaurant, and pool area. We ate all our meals in the restaurant and were surprised by the quality of the food offered. We were very happy with out stay here. I kind of wish we had stayed here longer instead of going to Flores to catch the bus to Belize the next morning."
50,"We stayed almost one week in  july 2014... The room 2a was perfect! The beds were so comfortable....the location was perfect for our two boys  (6-9) who would jump in the beautiful pool surrounded by the jungle which was twenty steps away....we saw spider monkeys and hauling monkeys walking and jumping around the trees very close to our room/mini house.... We heard them hauling several nights...one night around 3 in the morning I think they were sitting outside my door...what an incredible experience....the entrance to the tikal park is a five minute walk...if you are planning to visit tikal....i truly believe that you should stay at the jungle lodge at least one night to experience the jungle and feel what the Mayans felt more than 3,000 years ago.... Also, if you are going to"
40,"The sunrise tour was probably my favorite thing we did on vacation! The rooms are cute, but don't expect high tech amenities; they use a generator and you only get power twice per day...but I would (hands down) stay here again. I can't say enough about the staff--they were so helpful and friendly! We would definitely come back here!"
40,"My brother and I stayed in a bungalow.  The hotel itself is nice and Tikal is great.  It was nice to do a sunrise tour right there- the tour started at 4am, so we got to go out and watch the jungle wake up.  It was raining and we were tired and hungry so we returned to the hotel for breakfast and a nap and went back to the park at 12 for more ruins and thankfully it had stopped raining.  I don't know what we would have done if we weren't staying right there.  I guess we would have just been hungry, tired, wet, and miserable.  The beds were very comfortable.  The service was good and our waiters and tour guides were very nice.  There is a great pool to cool your heels in.  The food was excellent.  The fish was fresh and tasted so good I had it 2 nights in a row.  The only"
40,"This hotel has a lot of things going for it... location being #1 as it is inside the Tikal national park.  We booked the package that included sunrise and sunset tours (although the tour guide is provided by the hotel you are still required to buy an admission ticket into the park) as well as breakfast and dinner.  The food provided was nice... Eggs or pancakes for breakfast and several options for dinner including fish, chicken, and vegetarian.  The staff was also very helpful in setting up transportation for us back into Belize; and when we woke up to a scorpion in our bungalow they were quick to come in and spray around the room to make sure we didn't have any visitors the next day.   There were a few negatives about the hotel although most we were aware of before booking. "
40,"We were very happy with service during our stay at Tikal Inn. Despite a last minute change in transportation plans, there was someone from the hotel waiting for us when we arrived on our bus in Flores (even though all we could tell them was that we would arrive in ""8-10 hrs""). We also had a great guide for our sunrise tour.  As previous reviews have noted, it was very hot, there is no AC, the power is only on during specified times of the day, and the rooms are not exactly fancy. However, the hotel is right by the main park entrance, which makes it all worthwhile (Flores is about 1 hr 20 min away). We did the package deal that included meals, which worked fine for us."
40,"Good place to stay while visiting the temples of Tikal.  Helpful staff and guides.  Especially Edin Mendez who is very knowledgable about Mayan history and the Tikal Park.  The Hotel picks up passengers in Flores and at the airpot.  Edin served as a guide on the bus ride to the Park. He did an excellent job of explaining the history of Guatemala and points of interest along the way.  We were fortunate to have him as our guide for 2 walks thru the temples.  It added to our experience in the Park. Rooms were ample, but electricity only early morning and late evening. We had a cabin with a small front porch which made viewing the wildlife entertaining. The young man at the front desk was very helpful. Good restaurant and service."
50,"I wasn't expecting wifi or continuous electricity (especially because they told us electricity runs from. 5.30pm to midnight) but we had no all evening and the next day too. Bathrooms and clean, god knows how they keep the billions of bugs out but it was pretty bug free! Pool is nice to relax next too, a nice place to come back to after long walks in the ruins. Food was very nice, filling and well priced. Would highly recommend"
50,Clean hotel room with a spacious bathroom and mosquito nets. Decent food. Steps to Tikal. Not to mention you are surrounded by the living/breathing jungle. An exciting experience. we also participated in the sunrise Tika Tour with Antonio. he was an exceptional guide and the experience was well worth it.
40,"Jungle Lodge was the first housing structure in Tikal. It is right across from the park entrance.  Archeological teams have been staying there since its opening. Of the three hotels lined up by the entrance, Jungle Lodge has retained the most character. The waiter told me that the rooms have high beamed ceilings and comforts such as extended electricity hours, wifi and mosquito nets. (The other two don't have mosquito nets or 24/7 full power electricity. I know, because I stayed at both.)   The menu is more extensive than the simple menus of the other two hotel restaurants. The food was acceptable and the portions were fine. We were given complimentary cups of soup, which was a nice touch. The dining room is large, giving plenty of space between tables for private conversations."
40,"Well I guess I would start with the good things, the waiters in the restaurant are just amazing!!!! the room was clean and we did enjoy the pool. Overall they have a good service. Also I had to said that while in Guatemala I had some family issues and by mistake I canceled my reservation but they were so nice and kind of making sure I had a great experience in a quite room. The downside first of all when I ask how much would be the sunrise tour I got this price el precio sería de $. 48.00 por persona y es de 4ª.m. a 6ª.m. When we showed up they told us it was $35 per person. The guy at the front desk want us to pay right away, first of all our first guide tour was going to be ABEL, then he talked to us and said that he couldn´t so was going to be CESAR. Next day we showed up at"
40,"Like other's, we struggled to choose which Tikal Park property to stay at for our once in a lifetime Tikal visit and early morning tour.  Chose the lodge due to it's many positive Tripadvisor reviews and most important, the availability of a pool.  The idea of touring in the early morning and then coming back for a quick dip in the pool appealed to me! After being dropped off by my tour group so they could go back to Belize where we had left earlier in the day, we walked up the path to the Lodge reservation in hand.  We immediately noticed a troop of howler monkey's eating in the tree's above.  This was going to be fun! Reception was quick and easy.  We stayed in one of the duplex cabins.  Our cabin was close to the lobby.  Cabin 1 I believe.  The room had two queen beds, a"
20,We were not impressed at all with this hotel..the first thing it was hotter than heck and no electricity at certain times did not help. Would have been nice to have AC at night. We purchased a package with meals and sunrise tour included with the room. Or so we thought. We arrived late because our flight ran later than expected. Because we came in after 5:00 we were told we would have to pay for the morning sunrise tour and sure enough we were charged for three tickets.  It seemed as though they never had any change when we would try to purchase any drinks or snacks at the snack bar.  The food was good and the choices were good but you had to pay extra for your drinks including water. There were few English speaking staff to top it off. There was a mix up on paying for some
30,"We chose a hotel room and paid $95 per night.  Pros: clean, large rooms, nice pool, pretty grounds, excellent location for seeing Tikal, nice sunrise tour, reasonable package price (although definitely tourist-attraction price), fast email response in planning phase and free transport to Flores with excellent customer service.    Cons: Electricity and wifi from 6-10pm only – this was not made clear in any communication prior to check in, not in the lengthy email conversation, the thorough document they sent me or their website.   Possibly it’s the language barrier, my Spanish isn’t that great, but there seemed like a weird vibe with the staff.   Also we stayed two nights and after our first night our room was not cleaned.  The transportation arranged for us from San Ignacio to"
50,"This place is pretty basic but it has all that you need.  There are certain hours when they don't have electricity so plan accordingly!  We booked the hotel/dinner/tour package - worked out really well.   You fall asleep to the sounds of the jungle, wake up long before the sun rises, have a quick cup of coffee and head out on a great tour of the ruins.    Our guide was really great and very informative, he knew the answers to all our questions. He brought us through the trails around Tikal, and as the sun came up we heard the jungle wake up too!  Howler monkeys and birds galore, it was incredible! Our guide, Rony, took the 6 of us in our group up to the top of a temple and watched the sun rise - an experience i will forever cherish.  I would definitely recomend staying here"
40,"This hotel is in the middle of a forest. According to my minivan driver, nobody lives in the forest except banditos. The hotel is within easy walking distance of extensive Mayan ruins.   So this isn't your normal hotel. It is a hotel a long way inside a nature reserve, with an amazing archaeological site a skip and a jump away.   As a consequence you have to re-calibrate what you expect. This isn't Benidorm.  The positive:  The hotel is in an ideal place from which to walk to some spectacular ruins. The reception staff are friendly and welcoming, and will try hard to help you if you need anything out of the ordinary. The rooms are airy, spacious and clean, with comfortable beds. The shower works and provides warmish water. The restaurant provides edible food. WiFi is available"
30,"Overall this hotel was worth it for the great location in the park.  We purchased the package including dinner, breakfast, and the sunrise tour. I think my biggest complaint was that the dinner was very bland and the sunrise tour was obviously lacking compared to other tours we saw. Having said that, we enjoyed our room and had a great time relaxing in the hammocks by the pool.  If we were going to do it again we would not have done the package and would have done a different tour.  I think if we had done a different tour I may have given this hotel 4 stars instead of 3.  They do not tell you at booking but there is an additional fee for the sunrise tour that they will collect that morning.  No one in the tour appeared to know about this as we had paid an entrance fee when we"
40,"we stayed here in one of the rooms with shared bath for 45 USD/night. Although the room was a bit small, it was just fine and exceeded expectations. The shared restrooms were also clean and not used by many guests. Power cut was between 12:00-6:00 am, and not an issue. The staff was friendly and food was fine too. Fruits and juice for breakfast was not cold, not a surprise in the jungle.  Location right next to the entrance of the ruins could not be better. You can enjoy your beer at poolside chairs too. We enjoyed our stay here, and can recommend the shared rooms if you want to stay in the park but don't want to pay a small fortune."
50,"Sometimes I don't understand TA reviewers. Based on some of the reviews we expected mediocre accommodations. What we found was a lovely and well-landscaped hotel with very cozy little ""duplex"" cabins and extremely friendly and hospitable staff. You literally cannot have a more jungle-ly experience unless you take your sleeping bags and go camp in the woods. We were awakened at 2 AM by howler monkeys doing their thing directly above our cabin. After peeling myself off the ceiling I really appreciated the beauty and adventure of the experience. The next day the howler troop of 15 or so hung out right above our patio, soon to be joined by a troop of spider monkeys. Anyway, on the the review: As I said the cabins are delightful and extremely clean; the lodge building is very"
40,"We stayed three nights and everything about the lodge was better than we had been expecting. The food was good, the rooms and bathroom spacious and clean and the staff friendly. As for Tikal temples amazing, our guide Antonio was fantastic and we went out with him again on the second day to explore the less visited ruins. This was well worth it. We had an hour by the pool watching spider monkeys in the trees above us. terrific."
40,"We stayed here for two nights with our two kids. Perfect location, nice pool, and clean tidy room. We would say to pass on the restaurant due to uninteresting food, high prices and unfriendly service. On the other hand we did the sunrise hike with Rony Mendez and would highly recommend him as a guide! A fabulous experience!! We heard howler monkeys all night too :) "
50,"We, three, discounted the previous reports of poor service and food and opted to take the chance. The location in the park was perfect.  The design of the facility was definitely eco friendly.  The food and service were good.  Remembering this is not a city but out in the jungle, expectations should not be the same.  All the staff were most helpful with questions and service.  Life is slow in this area of the world and we should take time to enjoy it.  Our tour guide around the ruins was awesome knowing the wildlife and able to call the birds.  He definitely made the tour.  Yes it was hot, yes it was humid.  However, definitely worth the trip.  There is so much there!  We were able to sit on our terrace and enjoy the birds, wildlife and monkeys.  As stated, location could not be"
10,"My wive and I booked this hotel based on the reviews on Tripadvisor, BAD mistake. First of all, while going through some cumbersome booking process via email in English and in Spanish, we booked a hotel room for $98USD (meals included-requirement). Ervin, Tikal Inn's rep that booked our stay failed to informed us that we needed to arrive at 7:00am at their Flores' office to be transported free of charge, otherwise we needed to arrange our own transport to Tikal National Park and pay a park entrance fee. That said, we didn't arrive at 7:00am, therefore we did not know how to get there, and the taxi vultures are just preying to rip you off. We called Tikal Inn's office to inquire regarding transportation to the Park-Hotel, and Ervin informed us that there was a $20USD per person"
30,"Its difficult to understand why hotels that have access to captive clients due to their unique locations often provide sub standard facilities and service at prices that don't reflect their offering! One could be forgiven for thinking the price premium is for the location but the location itself is often paid for again and again with numerous entry fees and taxes which just adds additional insult to injury. In this particular case, whilst the rates themselves are not exorbitant, any hotel that provided these facilities and service in a ""normal"" location wouldn't get away with half what this hotel charges.  The full board and sunrise tours package certainly adds value to the offering but the lack of electricity except for between the hours of 6 and 10pm coupled to unbearable heat"
50,"When we arrived at this hotel just outside the archeolgical site in the jungle after a small bus ride from Flores, we were greeted in English which was a plus. We had some concerns about the booking which was made through e-mail and we did not receive a confirmation. Everything was as we had hoped. Internet service was ony available in the lobby and electric in the rooms was on from 6 pm to 10 pm. The cabana was comfortable as were the beds. We were there early April and there were no bugs and the evening was very nice for sleep.   We had the morning tour as part of our room and arranged for the afternoon tour on the day we arrived. We stayed only 1 night. Our guide for the afternoon and morning tour was Roni (row knee) and he was excellent. He was very knowledgeable but also"
30,"Pre- booking was difficult over the internet, possibly due to the language barrier.  upon my arrival, the front desk clerk spoke little English.  I was not aware that my meals were included until the following day, when the concierge was relieved.  That said, the rooms were very basic but clean.  I purposely chose the El Ranchon rooms at the back of the property in order to see the wildlife and was not disappointed.  Spider monkeys, pacas, coatimundi and turkeys freely roam the grounds.  I took the sunrise tour....a must do if you are staying in the park, and offered through the hotel.  Food was excellent, with large portions.  Sat by the pool which was very nice after a hot day in the sun.  bring insect repellent...not so much for the Mosquitos as the biting flies.  I did have"
40,"We contacted Tikal Inn two days before we arrived to ask for the rate and were told it was US$111 with the meal package and they do not do bookings without the meal package.  We arrived with others that had caught the bus with us and they were quoted US$95 for the same room and package.  When we asked for the reason for the price difference we were told we had booked a long way in advance, which we hadn't as we booked the day before.  We were then told it must be because we booked a bungalow which we hadn't and showed the email.  After some discussion they offered us a poolside bungalow for the same price or a garden bungalow for $100.  In amongst all this it would seem they gave our original economy room away to someone else that came in as we were told we couldn't have the"
40,"If you wish to get the best out of your trip to Tikal you must stay within the National Park, and if you do that you should stay here. Its drive lies immediately adjacent to the entrance to the archaeological site, and it provides the ideal spot from which to explore the ruins, enabling one to be the first in (sunrise from Temple IV highly recommended) and last out, while returning for a swim and a siesta during the heat of the day. The hotel itself is comfortable rather than luxurious, and a little dated, but you are not here for the hotel but for the great city of Tikal and the jungle wildlife. I swam with spider monkeys passing through the trees above my head, and returned in the evening to watch two coatimundis snoozing and preening each other on the branch of a tree."
40,"I would definitely recommend this hotel if you want to explore the park at dawn. Rooms were very good, clean and the bed was comfortable. Previous reports about poor service and bad food, didn't seem to be the case for me. There was a restricted menu, so maybe they have sorted out their kitchen, Quality and service in the restaurant was great. I would definitely recommend the 4.30 am visit to the park to see dawn break over the famous ruins of Tikal. Hearing the howler monkeys from Temple IV was a highlight of the trip. Remember, however, that you have to pay cash for the tour and also fir the colectivos. Make sure that you Have enough to hand."
40,"We visited Tikal as part of a package arranged by Audley Travel and their local agents Via Venture. At the time of our visit there were not many guests and meals were very good and the staff were friendly and helpful even though we spoke no Spanish. The rooms were a little dark, it could have been a problem as the electricity generator was not turned on until it was almost dark, and not turned on in the early morning when we had to make an early start, but we had torches with us. The fan also could only be used when the power was on, so it was a bit hot at times. The bathroom was spacious and clean.  We did not have time to use the pool but it looked very inviting!  Some of the guides used a path at the back of the hotel to enter the Tikal site. We were told to ask for our"
30,This is a great location in the Park with good access for visiting the Mayan ruins and birding.  Room accommodations very satisfactory and clean.  Food & beverage department needs serious revamping; staff needs customer service training; reduce the food choices for better food preparation (fewer choices & better prepared basic food). Front desk was very helpful.
40,"I wanted to visit Tikal every time we visited Belize, but never did. We were told by Day Trippers, who traveled from San Ignacio that it was too much to see in one day after you figure in the travel time. I planned this year with a pick up at the Guatemalan border which worked out much better. I got the experience I was looking for. Jungle Lodge picked us up at the border and we stopped in the lake district about 45 min from the park. at a great shop for coffee. I didn't expect much from this lodge but was very happy with our choice. We had a private bathroom and two double beds. It was clean and neat. Bring a face cloth,. We showered the night before and were sure we were in bed before electricity went off.. At 4AM some one woke us up  and we proceeded to the lodge to meet our"
40,"We stayed in the rooms out back ""close"" to the forest. The room was basic with two single beds located at the end of a cushy path through the garden. We saw wild turkeys and spider monkeys on the grounds. The location right at the gate to the park is well worth the stay here. We did both a sunrise and sunset tour. The sunset tour was excellent but the morning was less effective, go on your own. The fees to enter the park seem to be inconsistent in their application you may or may not be charged the extra fee for early/late entry. The ruins are fantastic and the wildlife was really interesting we saw lots of coati mundi, monkeys, agouti, toucans and many different species of birds. Tikal can be very hot so the pool is a welcome bonus after all the walking. The service in the"
40,"You can't be in a better location to visit the park.  Make sure you go to the park early in the morning -- especially if you like wildlife.  The rooms are basic but clean, nice pool -- breakfast in the hotel restaurant is fine but skip the dinner."
50,"Whether you take the guided tours or venture off w/your own guide books & research, you will appreciate being surrounded by a jungle like the Mayans inhabited, where the jungle has mounded over thousands of structures, not yet exposed. Edi was the best guide imaginable, being a university student specializing in Archeology, he took the ordinary black and white grounds tour into blazing color, even 3D. The hotel food was great and the service, even better. Manager Ricky at the front desk is dedicated and efficient; always helpful and accomodating.  It is neat the way they conserve energy. Electricity [including heating your shower water] is on from 6PM to 10PM and 6AM to 8AM. Battery powered lighting available in cabanas. The nIce thing about these power outages is quietness"
50,"I will first like to add that I have the best experience visitin Peten ever.  It was all due to this great hotel and Ricardo.  Although I did not get a chance to meet him in person he made sure my visit was very great.  My wife and I stayed in one of the Cabanas in the back of the hotel away from all the noise of the front.  Breakfast was good and dinner as well.  These were included in my package.  Drinks are a bit on the hight en but its to be expected.  We had lunch one day in the hotel and the other day we ventured outside.  We had the 4am dawn tour to tikal which was nothing but amazing.  Ricardo arranged for us to be dropped off at Flores on our way back to Guatemala.  This was something extra he did for us, and I wanted to make sure to thank him here. My next visit will"
20,"The hotel is located in the park so we decided it would be worth the high cost to stay close to this ancient historical site.  The package deal food choices were limited and the amount of food was not enough to fill a small child.  The staff was not interested in making our stay more enjoyable, they had a constant clientele and were not the friendly people we met all throughout Guatemala.  We loved the ruins but felt like we had escaped high priced gouging at the hotel when we finally left and spend some wonderful days on the lake outside of Flores.  When we return we will definitely not stay with Hotel Tikal."
30,Cheapest way to stay if want to stay in the Reserve but don't expect much beyond basic accommodations.  Food was not great and service was average but the price is right if trying to save a few bucks.  Also know it's dark and cold at night wherever you stay -  very unexpected. 
30,"Pros: Great location, right in the middle of the park. Save yourself some valuable time. Nice rooms, better than expected.  I had a remodeled bathroom. Fan worked, electricity worked (though it only runs from 5pm to 10pm) Wifi, though be prepared, it runs realllll slow.  Basic email at best. Decent restaurant.  Cons: No air-con Restaurant staff are pretty disinterested, though lobby staff w"
40,"The Jungle Lodge is the place to stay so that you can enjoy Tikal in all of its wild glory without roasting with the daytrippers in the mid-day torpor. It is clean enough, the power may go out so pack a flashlight, and you may need to take a cold shower. In my husband's case, he took two cold showers because he did not realize that the ""C"" was the hot water and the ""H"" was the cold (we think the Spanish-speaking plumber hooked up the hot water ""caliente"" first and didn't know what to do with the ""H"" for the English-language fixtures). The mosquito net, which was not particularly necessary in March, had holes. You are sleeping in the jungle, so it will be noisy. The howler monkeys (which are NOT baboons and do not make the singing howl but something more like a sustained growl"
30,"We stayed 3 nights here at the end of our trip and had extended the stay by a day in order to relax by the pool for a day before we flew home. It was therefore very disappointing to find the pool half empty and under repair. Had we been aware of this in advance, we would have spent a day less here and had an extra day in Belize. Nevertheless it is perfectly positioned for the Tikal ruins (20 minutes walk) and, whilst it is certainly not luxurious, it is better than we expected. We had 17b, described as a junior suite, We had a comfortable four poster bed with mosquito nets (none of which met, leaving 6 or 8 inch gaps all round and on top) and a sofa with no adjacent lighting. The wildlife generally was atmospheric and no problem, though there was a series of loud bangs on our"
30,"After a noisy flight from Guatemala City in a small aircraft, and an hours bumpy mini bus ride in the dark we arrived at the National Park where the lodge is situated. Not luxurious by any means, but that's not what we were there for. The food was OK, cabin  1A  adequate, en suite bathroom functional, hot water intermittent, and electricity not on all the time. The boxed breakfast was not to our taste, but we were there only for the amazing Myan Ruins of Tikal, something we had waited 14 years to see. The swimming pool was lovely and it was great to cool off there and relax after all the walking we did. The gardens were nice and we had a family of coati's race through the area outside our cabin  early evening."
40,"Nice, somewhat private, accommodations with thatch roofs. These are open screened at top for air circulation so conversations from other cabanas can sometimes be heard.  Bath rooms are fairly nice for aN eco-lodge type environment.  Clean and plenty of room.  Very pretty and convenient location.  Was here on a birding trip and the National Park is a must see, not to mention the Inn grounds.  A word to photographers - Make sure you have 2 cameras with you or pack the one in a bag with plenty of desiccant. The humidity will KILL DSLRs. Happened to us and another couple.  Luckily, the moisture subsided and the camera began working the next day with no further problems.  Also, remember the power goes off at around 9 PM and comes back on at around 8AM so plan accordingly!"
40,"This is not a luxury property, but it is very comfortable. Its limitations (limited generator electricity, spotty wifi, etc) are the flipside of being immersed in the park, which is an ideal place to explore the ruins from. The staff are very friendly and attentive. The included meals are filling and we were very pleased to find they had vegetarian options. We LOVED the early morning ""sunrise"" tour in spite of it being too cloudy to see the sun - the sounds of the jungle were amazing and it was a good 20 degrees cooler than when we returned later in the day. The guide hired by the hotel was very knowledgable."
30,"You can't ask for a better location when visiting Tikal ruins. The hotel is within walking distance. However, I think that they could do better.  Very few of the staff speak English so communication can be a little difficult. The rooms are basic but clean. We stayed in a pool view suite. Electricity goes off at 10pm and only comes on again around 6 am. Dinner was included in our package which is logical as there is nowhere else to eat!!  Food was basic but good. Pool lovely and really nice to come back to after a hot day at the ruins. Top tip - take a torch!"
40,"One of the three lodges at the entrance to the archeological site, the Tikal Inn is an excellent choice for those staying in the park.  Staff members are friendly and helpful, rooms are clean and adequate, restaurant serves good food, there is a lovely garden with a pool.  Electricity is rationed and internet access is sketchy.  Packages include breakfast and dinner, and a guided tour of the ruins.  My guide was very friendly and led an interesting tour, but his command of English was limited."
40,"In January I spent some time in Belize with a side trip to Tikal National Park In Guatemala. The park, of course,was fantastic. The Inn was very good. I had read some reviews that did not make it sound all that great but it was really good. The restaurant service was quick and efficient and the staff were all friendly and helpful. After spending time visiting the ruins a dip in the pool was perfect. In the morning the howler monkeys, the wild turkeys and all sorts of other birds were right there. The room was comfortable and the shower had hot water. (We had been a few places where the showers did not have hot water.) I would recommend the Inn."
20,"The cabins here are basic but adequate for use though ours had loose and damaged fittings in places.  The shower works but as you would expect the pressure is very low and the water is lukewarm at times so my advice is shower early.  Electricity is available from between 5pm and 1030pm (mostly!).  The lodge itself has an excellent location right inside the park but I think they rely on this too much to bring in custom.  I think your experince here depends very much on when you come, which staff you interact with and whether you are in a group or travelling indpendently.  If you are the latter and they have a big group in then pretty much they don't care what happens to you.    For example at mealtimes we weren't able to get a clean table or even clean cutlery, crockery etc as"
40,"You are in the jungles of Guatemala so don't expect luxury. But the Jungle Lodge is perfect for a one night stay. The hotel is located just a few feet from the entrance to the National Park so it is easy to come and go when you like. The rooms are in bungalows that are perfectly adequate. They turn off the electricity during the afternoon and then again during the night which shouldn't be a problem unless it is really hot (the fans go off). The mosquito nets are great for the bugs. You are surrounded by the jungle and the constant sounds of the birds and occasionally the monkeys is great. The hotel offers a great package including two meals, entrance to the park and a guided tour which is a great value and should be selected. Our reservation was messed up (wrong date) but they"
30,"The cabin rooms are fairly basic but perfectly adequate. The electricity only functioning from 5pm to 10pm each day is a nuisance, especially for early starts - which is the point of being there! The restaurant staff were friendly and the food was OK. The 'box breakfasts' were generous but American-style. Being able to walk into the ruins in less than 10 minutes is what it is all about."
50,This was touted as the best of the three lodges to stay at when going to Tikal.  I have to agree as while we were there I saw the other two.  This was very convenient to the ruins at Tikal and the hotel staff was very helpful in finding a guide for us.  I use a CPAP so I needed electricity at night and was able to get the hotel to keep the power on to our room for a nominal fee.  The front desk should have had MORE CHANGE for the guests because it was hard to find change to enable us to tip the staff.  The ATM's give you large bills and the front desk did not have change.  The restaurant needs to be staffed a little better also since one night our dinner took almost an hour!
30,"The bungalow was nice and comfortable, electricity saving times were not an issue except on departure day before 6pm, but as the weather had been extremely rainy and I guess the room had been made a few days before we checked in, the sheets felt damp when slipping into them - not a nice sensation!  Food was fairly average, avoid the pasta, which is heavy and tasteless. Traditional dishes are much better.  Staff tries, but is of uneven competence, weak, lukewarm coffee for breakfast. "
40,"I think this place is good value.  Arrived late at night, no reservation, and got US$40 single fan room C-11, not a bungalow.  I think electricity goes off at 10 pm, no problem for me.  Pool looked good.  The service and food at breakfast were good.  Wifi too,  It was quiet there."
40,"We had a truly wonderful visit to Tikal with a stay at the Tikal Inn.  I would like to thank my fellow Trip Advisor reviewers because if not for their warning I might have been truly terrorized by the giant cockroach that I found on my curtain window!  He was dispatched quickly and my husband put something on the floor to close a small gap under the door and we had no further problem.  There were quite a few ants around the bathroom sink at one point, but I killed them and they did not return.  Like my father always used to say - ""it's just nature, little one"".    We had no problems with hot water availability between 6:00AM - 8:00AM, and after the lights went out at 10:00pm, I think I had the best night's sleep I've had in a long time.   I could not hear my neighbors in their"
30,"While many were upset about the limited electricity and hot water, what got me was the inability of the restaurant to manage the dining.  Dinner and breakfast were included in our hotel costs so we ate there two times a day for three days.  They always seemed to have adequate staffing numbers but couldn't seem to manage getting the limited menu food items actually to the table.  Every dinner had soup and yet you would sometimes wait over 3/4 of an hour for the first course of soup.  Getting tea and/or coffee with dinner was impossible and never hot.  The food was american-styled when most likely local food dishes may have been easier and better.  It was frustrating.  For food try the local street vendors at the park entrance.  On the upside, the hotel rooms were clean and"
50,"We really liked our visit to Tikal Inn and would recommend a stay there, despite the higher cost. Overall, it is a relaxing haven and the best thing to do after an exhausting day at the Mayan ruins is to relax by the pool and not have internet!  Pros: - Service was great -- the staff helped us take care of several requests - There were quite a few small animals wandering around the grounds, which was a delight - Breakfast, while limited (with a set menu) is very decent - Bungalow rooms by the pool were spacious enough with a nice, semi-outdoor bathroom. - The hotel package had a sunrise (or sunset) tour included but we couldn't make either...and there was also a free hotel transfer from Flores that we also couldn't make.   Cons: - The included dinner in the package was so-so"
20,"Eight of us were here for 2 nights.  We had read the reviews and weren't expecting much, but it was worse than anticipated.  The entire facility looks like it was designed and constructed in the mid-60's and not much done since then.  The rooms/bathrooms are spartan at best, poor quality linens, polyester sheets/bedspreads, mismatched furniture, no amenities.  The food in the restaurant was plain and over priced.  Any requests to staff were met with a grudging nod.  The ONLY reason to stay here is it's proximity to the ruins."
30,"If you want to get the most out of your stay in Tikal, fork out for one of the 3 hotels at the entrance. Jungle lodge is the biggest and nearest, rooms dark, spotlessly clean, water just about caliente. Food ok, few tourists staying so staff seemed lacklustre."
30,"We stayed at the Jungle Lodge for one night while visiting Tikal. It is a simple and rustic place. While we were there it was pouring down rain, so perhaps we did not see the facility at it's best. Our room was comfortable, the bathroom was beautiful and modern. The food service was OK, not great. But you've got to remember that you are in the middle of a jungle, if you need fine service and haute cuisine, don't come to Tikal. I should also mention that the Jungle Lodge uses it's own generators to provide electricity. I am not sure why thet have to do that, but again, it's a jungle. So the electricity is not always on. They do keep it on from 5:30 PM until 10:30 PM. Presumably you are in bed and asleep by that time.  The staff was helpful and hospitable. The front desk people"
30,"My wife and I stayed 2 nights in a bungalow room. I emailed the lodge in Spanish using Google translate and got prompt replies from reservations. I call it a room rather than a bungalow because it shares a duplex with another bungalow room. The room next door was quiet, but that probably depends on who is staying there.  The room was spacious, clean, and tidy. The shower was large, but hot water was not always available.  Power was turned off at times, but not always at the same time each day. The grounds are beautifully landscaped and maintained, and the bungalows were accessed along stone pathways.  It is very convenient to walking into the park. We visited Flores after we left and were glad we did not have to do that drive every day, although it would have given us better"
50,"Visited Tikal for 2 nights with family (2 teens). We travelled in a private shuttle from Pana overnight and reached Jungle lodge at 7 in the morning and were pleasantly surprised at the reception we got. The staff was very courteous and helpful. The bungalow or cottage or room, whatever they call it, was outstanding. The cleanliness stood out the most. Everything is maintained so well, no cobwebs, or cracks, stains .... The washroom was excellent with a skylight ... so ecofriendly. The surroundings are well maintained, giving you the rustic feel, yet safe and clean. There is a very beautiful pool which we could not use as it was pretty cool in December.  Another notable feature of the Lodge is its restaurant, which not only has a lot of history behind it, but also serves"
40,We stayed one night to visit Tikal and the place is fine. Clean and tidy - nothing fancy or more than what is needed. Power is on for only a few hrs at night and morning - it's an easy walk into the park to tour Mayan ruins.  The bummer was the food at the restaurant and the service - everything took a long time and our breakfast was bland and almost inedible. Dinner and drinks were ok but the two meals at the com idea up the road was much better and authentic.  The fun part was seeing Monkeys while at the pool.    
40,"We stayed 2 nights, which seems to be the norm, and absolutely enjoyed the experience.  We had a bungalow which was spacious and clean with a large shower.  There are back-up lights in the rooms now that charge when the power is on, so you will have adequate lighting for those early mornings preparing for the sunrise trek - an absolute MUST as the howler monkeys sound like huge lions in the pre-dawn quiet of the jungle!  The staff were friendly and helpful with all requests, and we had a lot of fun with them.  The pool is heated (nice surprise) and sitting and watching all the wildlife is great entertainment! It is so worth staying in the park instead of Flores, especially for the sunrise trek, and we felt like the only people on site most of the time."
40,"We were really concerned based on many of the prior reviews but were pleasantly surprised!  The location is perfect and our experience with the staff was great!  We didn't have anyone who was less than helpful or friendly in the 2 nights we stayed.  Sure, the cockroach in our room was not cool, but you're in a rainforest so what do you expect?  We enjoyed the pool, and especially the grounds which were often filled with local wildlife - coatimundi, spider monkeys, toucan, aricari, agouti (and that was just what we saw in a day and a half).  The food was ok, but I would agree with other reviewers - don't get the package deal other than maybe breakfast.  The menu in the restaurant is fairly extensive but your choices if you have the included meal is extremely limited (chicken,"
40,"This is a beautiful place to stay, right in the park enabling visits to the ruins earl in the mornig as the jung,e wakes up - beautiful.  We stayed in a bungalow room and it was great, overlooking a large grassed area on which strange creatures entertained us.  We signed up for a package that included breakfast and dinner each day. We wished we hadn't. When we sat down for our first, evening meal we were given a quite interesting looking menu but when we informed our waiter that we were on the package, this was whisked away and replaced by a three choice main course list.  Ugh! A bowl of spaghetti with absolutely no accompianment was one choice, the other two tastess and unfortunately not forgetable.   Apart from the food we loved everything else about this hotel: howling"
40,you have to remem ber you are in the jungle. the staff were wonderful. Had a bit of trouble with room  when we first checked in . room b6-8 are right next to the bar and do not get much air. there is no airconditioning so air is important. after some discussion we were moved to a bungalow c-10 which was perfect. We had 2 of 3 meals on the meal plan and the chick was adequate and the breakfast quite good. the other meal from the menu was quite acceptable. the pool was clean and very refrreshing. Remember the rolling blackouts as pointed out by others and you have no problems here
50,"The Tikal Inn is perfectly situated a hundred yards from the central point of the Park. It's a beautiful setting - we stayed in one of the bungalows that are 15 feet from the swimming pool. There are rooms in the main building, but can't comment on them. The included dinner and breakfast was very good - they were set meals with a choice of three items. The staff (Orillio and ??? were very courteous and helpful, including carrying our bags to our vehicle. The included sunrise tour is a must do - both the sunrise itself and the sounds of the jungle waking up are unique experiences. We should have left without the discourteous guests that kept everyone else waiting for 45 minutes though (waking up at 3:45 am is bad enough!). There was wildlife in the grounds by the pool for our"
40,"While we didn't come to Tikal for the accommodations, I was pleasantly surprised.  There are only 3 available in the park and this one was planned by our travel agent.  We had 2 rooms to accomodate 4 of us.  Girls vs boys!  The rooms were very nice.  Bathrooms were larger in one than the other including a large shower.  There are mosquito nets on all the beds.  I don't know if that is for decor or bug management, but we used them anyway.  They do provide typical small shampoo & soaps.  Front desk staff were helpful, but not overly pleasant.  He did do everything we asked, so I can't complain.    The restaurant brings on mixed feelings.  The waitress spoke very little english while we spoke very little spanish.  However she was eager to teach us and it made it much more"
20,"The room was nice and clean. The food was horrible, eat next store. The main point is the service. It is as if they don't know what business they are in. Their attitudes were not good. Really? You can't get anyone a cup of coffee before time x even though the flights leave early and there are sunrise tours into the park? The owner needs to get in there and do some serious training. Put the hospitable back into the hospitality business."
30,"Stayed one night, as all the other park hotels were booked.  Very expensive by Guatemalan standards.  Check in was fairly easy and quick and although the front desk people were nice enough, it was obvious that they deal with foreign tourists day in and out and their jobs are a bit of a grind.  Totally understandable though.    Room was perfectly perfunctory.  Double beds, dresser, chifforobe and a bathroom with sizable shower.  There are two chairs for lounging on the patio of the structures (fashioned like a duplex, basically), although we couldn't use them because of the mosquitos.  What I disliked VERY much about the property, although beautifully landscaped and designed (loved the red color) was the sidewalk throughout.  They embedded large chunks of rock into concrete, but"
40,"We were kindly picked up at the airport and taken to the hotel, even made a requested stop for fresh tortillas on the road! Rooms were great, clean and spacious. We loved to listen to nature when going to sleep and waking up. Extremely convenient location, it allowed us to enjoy the park as much as we wanted. Watch out, no hot water during early hours in the morning. Staff was very cordial and helpful. It was our second stay at the hotel, and don't doubt there will be a third!"
50,"Overall, this was the best hotel experience one could reasonably expect in a jungle.  Pros: nice bungalow rooms, good hot water, pleasant little private deck with Adirondack chairs, plenty of wildlife visible even on hotel grounds.  Cons: electricity is on for only a few hours in the morning, 11am-2pm and 5pm to 11pm. Not overnight. Bring a flashlight for every person in your party. Wifi sucks here.   Keep in mind that this is the jungle. There are plenty of very big bugs (cool actually, if you get into that kind of thing). Four star type accomodations are not possible. Howler monkeys can be loud at certain times (again, can be great if you are in the right frame of mind).   Food at this hotel is lousy and overpriced. They are trying to prepare 4 star type international hotel"
50,"We arranged to have the Inn pick us up from the airport in Flores and drive us the 1 hour trip to the park.  Since the Inn is inside the park boundaries, you can be the first to see the sites in the morning and avoid the crowds that arrive around 10am.    We paid for an early-bird tour (starting at 4am) and even did the sunset tour of the ruins (you can stay after normal closing hours at 6pm).  Wonderful, unique experience all around.  The Inn doesn't have power all of the time, but it is sunny and you really only need power at night.  Bring a flashlight and you'll be fine.  The power stays on until 10pm and we were so tired after all the climbing that we were ready to sleep then anyhow.  You are in the midst of a forest, so you can see some bugs.  Bring bug spray.  (This would"
50,"We stayed at Tikal Inn for four nights in February 2013.  The setting is spectacular and if you're interested in getting away from everyday life go to Tikal Inn where you can wake up to the sounds of the jungle and experience first hand the creatures waking up each morning at sunrise.    Yes, electricty is limited during the day, and there are not the five star creature comforts of a five star hotel experience at the Inn or in the park..  Although all staff are not fluent in English they make every effort to make your time at Tikal Inn pleasant and welcoming.  We looked at the experience as being guests in Guatemala and adjusted our expectations accordingly.  Special thanks to Michael and Juan Emanual for the extra efforts you made to make our time at Tikal Inn memorable.  What"
40,That says it all. We were able to make 3 trips into the park as there is too much to take in in one hit. The sunrise tour was a bit of a let down as it was very cloudy but none the less to be up on temple 4 at 5:00am was a unique experience. What followed was an excellent tour of the monuments and wild life by our guide until around 8:00am.  Transport arrangements were made for us to the Belize border. The Ranchon room was fine..... Family of coatis live close by. The dinners were very uninspired but adequate. Same for breakfast. The nearest Comedor is good. Very glad we chose this venue for the temple visits. All the staff are helpful and the pool is a great bonus.
50,"Great location, 5 mins walk from the entrance to the park. We had a poolside bungalow, at $130/night it was worth it.Room was great, absolutely no complaints. Pool is large and clean.Grounds are beautiful, all kinds of animals and birds.The guides are fluent in English, the front desk not so much.Some of the complaints that I've read are most likely from misunderstandings. The staff is very friendly.  Considering the location and the price , it's a great value. Food is fine.You're there to see the ruins not dine 5 star. If you're going on the sunrise tour you have to go with a guide and it's an additional 100Q entrance fee on top of the 150Q day entrance. You do NOT need a guide at sunset. You see both sunrise and sunset from temple 4.Take a flashlight.The park is huge, it's a"
40,"Awesome location,walking distance to park so you can leave for an early hike in the morning and come back for lunch and head right back out again for an evening in the park to listen to the houler monkeys and macaws.the food is outstanding  and the staff very friendly ( not alot of english though) great pool and surroundings.would stay there a again"
40,"The hotel grounds are quite beautiful. We stayed in single private rooms without bathrooms. The rooms are simple but the bed was very comfortable (one of the best I slept in in Guate), the bathrooms clean, and the service was friendly. There is wifi in the lounge area. They have clearly worked very hard to please guests here over the years ad   The lodge is two minutes outside the park, which is very convenient (then again so is everything else if you stay in Tikal and not in Flores/Santa Elena). Unless you camp out, staying in Tikal itself is incredibly expensive compared to everything else in Guatemala. I paid 320Q ($40) for a private room with shared bath at Jungle Lodge, which is about double what I paid anywhere else in the country for a single w/ shared bath, but that's"
40,"Large, attractive rooms, great pool, friendly service in the dining room with very good food made for a very nice visit!  This hotel should get better reviews than it does!Great location for exploring the extensive ruins at Tikal."
40,"Jungle Lodge is a simple place.  The rooms are fairly basic but more than adequate with big bathrooms and mosquito nets and fans over the beds.  Since you'll be out at the Mayan ruins all day and hopefully in the restaurant or bar in the evening, this is just fine.  The staff were more than helpful and friendly and even found us spare (used) tickets when we lost ours and wanted them as a momento. There's free wifi too - not fast, but it isn't anywhere in Northern Guatemala or Belize.  I'd recommend the Jungle Lodge for the above and also because it's right in the Park, right next to the entrance to the ruins - you can stay till dark when everyone else has gone home earlier and easily get back."
50,"This beautiful hotel is situated not 5 mins from the entrance to the site. I arranged for them to pick me up from the airport and they were right there waiting. The staff was always polite and eager to help. My guide, Carlos, was amazing. I did both the sunrise and sunset tour with him and he was extremely knowledgeable about the site and past of the Mayans.  He even arranged for me to upgrade to one of the hotel's private bungalows with ensuite bathroom because the hotel wasn't packed.  And the food at the hotel was amazing.  If you're willing to go above budget on your time in Tikal, I HIGHLY recommend staying here...and ask for Carlos!"
50,"Going to Tikal was a long-time goal of mine, and I was concerned about getting a safe place to stay.  Just got back (November) and The Jungle Lodge exceeded my expectations!  It's in the middle of the wonderful jungle foliage with well-kept gardens, monkeys up above (way high up) and clean bungalows.  There are mosquito nets for the beds, but I was amazed at how few we actually saw (outside).  I'm usually covered with bites no matter what I put on, but I came home with only 2 - both of which I got while visiting the pyramids!   The people who work there are some of the warmest most welcoming I've ever met.  The brothers that own the place are truly interested in knowing you and making sure that everything about your visit is going well for you.  The food is really good - water,"
50,"This place is amazing! We ended up booking through a travel agency in Flores (Myan Princess) failed to mention the hotel provided transportation and convinced us to buy transportation through them (don't go there). When we arrived at the park entrance the shuttle dropped us off and told us to wait in hour till 3pm so our ticket to he park would be good for the next day.  So now not only did Myan Princess make $24 off of us, but we were stranded at the park entrance which is at least 30 min from the hotel! I called the hotel and spoke with Riccardo.  Not only did he call the canopy excursion company at the entrance to provide us transportation, but he also upgraded out room for the stay! At the hotel we needed to setup a shuttle for our friend. We did not know what time her bus"
40,"If you are visiting the ruins at Tikal, this hotel or the Jaguar Inn are your only two options for staying overnight, which I highly recommend that you do if you go there for two reasons: sunset and sunrise tours of the ruins. Also, spending a night in the middle of the jungle is a pretty unique experience. The Hotel Tikal Inn was a good choice - the staff was friendly and the room nice. There is a restaurant at the hotel with overall good food and service. There is also a pool and some deck chairs though we didn't really have time to use, and it didn't seem like anyone else did either. The main attraction is the ruins and the hotel is around a ten minute walk from the start of the park. The ruins are amazing and the park trails well maintained. My only gripe with the hotel is"
40,"First let me start saying that I read the story of the girl that had a problem with the reservation (the hotel said she´s booked 2 nights, but she booked only one). Well, I had a similar issue. My package had the sunrise and sunset tours included, but at the reception they said I only had the sunset. Only after I showed the email they believed me. So, ask for a formal voucher from the hotel via email and bring a copy of the details of your reservation with you.  We stayed at the furthest place from the reception, called El Ranchon. It costed 100 USD a night. The accommodation was simple but nice. No mozzies or insects and nice night of sleep.  The great advantage of staying here is the convenience to visit the park. We had done a day trip. a sunset trip and a sunrise trip. The"
20,"My boyfriend and I stayed here for 1 night in January. I will start on a positive note....The hotel is convenient to see Tikal, and they have a beautiful pool, I will give them that. But the service and the rooms were bad. Upon arriving, they tried to tell me I had booked 2 nights, even though I had only booked one. They said I could not cancel the 2nd night because it was to late and I would have to pay for both nights. I was furious. Thank god I had my ipad with me and had saved all the emails corresponding with the hotel. I showed them the emails I had sent booking only one night. They said they'd get back to me. An hour later, they said it was fine, I didn't have to pay the cancellation fee for the 2nd night. As if they expected me to be thankful for not charging me....even"
40,"This is a very good hotel if you want to visit the ruins of the ancient city of Tikal at sunrise. The rooms are very big and clean, and the hotel has a swimming pool surrounded by beautiful gardens. Hot water is also available, but after 10pm, there is no electricity. The cost of rooms in this hotel is a little more expensive than hotels in the nearest town at Flores, but taking into account the unique location in the center of the ruins of Tikal, the cost is very reasonable."
40,"We can solidly recommend the Jungle Lodge.  Pros:  clean room, quaint surroundings, great location. Friendly staff - especially our guide Carlos and front desk receptionist Kevin, who offered to give us a personally guided tour of Flores.  Cons: we had to change bungalows because there was no power in the first one, but it was accomplished without fuss or drama. The power is controlled by generator and is not always on, but this is standard for all hotels in the park. The food in the restaurant was good, but they were out of a lot of items on the menu. The pool was great. Betsy and Michael"
20,"Our family of 4 stayed here for one night in order to take the sunrise tour at Tikal.  The tour was well worth it.  While we didn't see the sun rise (I think very few people do), hearing the jungle come to life as the sun rose (literally went from silence to cacophony of chirps, grunts groans and screeches in moments) was worth the trip.  This was the only hotel in all of Guatemala where I felt the staff was trying to rip me off.  They didn't come across as honest nor were they particularly helpful.  The room wasn't cheap and the food wasn't good, but making it out on the sunrise tour and having a couple of hours in the park before the crowds arrived was well worth it.  Be prepared to pay too much for a tour guide, transportation and anything else you want, but set the money"
10,"Room was filthy!  Floor in the room was not cleaned and the shower was also very dirty.  The closet reeked of mildew and inside the drawer of the bed stand, there were the moldy remains of something long left behind to rot there.  Employees of the hotel are of little to no help, probably because there are so few options to choose from if you want to stay close to the ruins."
40,"The owner was one of the first guides at Tikal and if you can get him to do a tour for you--very awesome.  At the main reception desk is decent wireless internet, no where else can you find this.  Rooms are comfortable, but no A/C.  Food is excellent from the kitchen, on the pricey side.  The driveway puts you right into the Tikal park, very convenient.  For being out in the jungle, it sure has all the amenities of a normal hotel within reason.  Just remember you are in a very remote part of the world and staying here made it quite comfortable."
30,"It's great to be right in the park, and since we were doing a sunrise tour it was important for us to be there, but $129 for one night is a lot for Belize. The room was clean, but we found a giant tarantula clinging on the curtain (I ran for a cleaning person who chased it out with a broom), and that night a huge scorpion that ran under the dresser (we carefully checked all our luggage before packing the next day). But it is the jungle. The beds had mosquito netting, the windows were screened, and there was a ceiling fan but it was very loud and not that effective, so the night was hot. On the plus side, the hotel packed decent breakfast boxes for our 4:30am tour - due to rain delay we didn't actually go till 6:30, but we ate breakfast at the top of a temple, very cool.  And the"
40,"If you are going to Tikal Ruins, make a stop and stay inside the park. The rooms are comfortable, the restaurant is great and the food is awesome! You can trust in the hotel's guides and enjoy your ride around Tikal. They have internet and pool in the hotel."
50,"We traveled to Tikal for two days without a reservation at any of the hotels so that we could see our options. Hotel Tikal had the best value for our family of four (2 adults, 7 & 10 y/o).   We choose the package and were also given prices for just the room. Our pack included the sunrise & sunset tours as well as breakfasts and dinners. Meals were traditional/basic but filling and the wait staff was great. The tours were a good value for what we needed and kept the kids interest the whole time.   In conclusion let me tell you why I would go back. First, the pool. The kids and I spent many good hours in its clean warm water. Second was after we left and we were just coming into Flores about an hour away. My wife relized that she had left her iPhone in Tikal. Long story short they"
40,"My wife and I actually enjoyed Tikal Inn - we were definitely expecting worse from the previous reviews. Certainly not cheap but included breakfast, dinner and a good guide for the sunrise tour. Can't comment on anything other than the bungalow we stayed in which overlooked the lawn area, but it was clean, had warm water and plenty of space. We got online with our laptop from the restaurant / reception area without any problems. And it's a few minutes walk from the Inn to the ruins entry."
40,"It is made very clear that there is electricity only between certain hours, and to be honest this was not a problem. Our room had a battery light which worked when the power was not on, and I believe all the rooms have these. We had boiling hot water on both nights at around 6.45pm, the power comes on at 6 and starts to heat the water. Mornings did not seem quite as good but a shower at the end of the day suited me fine. We eat all our meals here, no complaints, you are in the jungle so it's not going to be haute cuisine. The choice for included meals is more limited but we found them well cooked and fresh. Staff were always friendly and the guide Ronnie particularly good. Coffee was served before the sunrise tour. Internet not up to much but your on holiday and in the jungle!! "
30,"We stayed here for 3 nights and had a great room. Our room was on the top floor of a quad-plex overlooking the pool. We told them we not going on any sunrise or sunset tours and wanted a quiet room. We booked quite a few months ahead and perhaps that is why we got such a nice room. No bugs anywhere, quiet room and dry towels each day. Dry is the key word here in the jungle as nothing dries at all. Power is on from 6-8 am and 6-10 pm and we knew that. Take a flashlight or headlamp!!! Food was reasonably priced and we only took a package which included breakfast. Much better choices for dinner if you do not do a package plan."
20,Jungle Lodge is in a great setting. The wildlife is fantastic and the rooms are spacious and nestle beautifully amongst the jungle foliage. Overall it is expensive by Guatemala standards and the service was not great. Checking in took far too long and we seemed to be rather a bother to the receptionist. We stayed three nights and although not evident until our last day we discovered they had BED BUGS. A week later and I'm still scratching. 
50,"As an Eagle Scout and much summer camp experience, the Jungle Lodge reminded me of a summer with my troop. I had been staying in upscale hotels prior to the lodge and getting away was a nice feeling. It was simple, extremely simple, but it made it very relaxing. The rooms did not  have air conditioning but a very effective fan. The restaurant was very good and the service was fantastic."
30,"Stayed here and there was nothing wrong with it but more a 3 star hotel that was charging 5 star prices. The rooms were fine, but not air on. The power went off during the night. The girl at reception was very fussy and made everything more difficult than it should have been. The rest of the staff were great and the food was fine, though a bit limited. There was a very quaint soup and desert served without being ordered with dinner. The coffee was not great and sat in the dripped so not sure how fresh it was ever and they often didn't have things that were on the menu. I think if the rates were more reasonable I would have been happy with the place."
50,"I stayed there a few times in May, and everyone just made my stay and my work incredibly amazing.   In other moments I've stayed there with film crews and also incredibly amazing service, even preparing coffee and snacks for very early starts in the morning.  If you love photography, it is also an amazing and stunning place to be."
50,"Rooms were clean. Bathrooms were clean. Not throwing toilet paper into the commode took some getting use to. You cant flush it you have to use the trash can. A little different.  The restaurant had ok foo. Food in Belize was better. Not thrown together but, homemade. They have a nice pool area. They have a small gift shop and a bar. Be careful of them ""NOT HAVING ANY CHANGE"" scam. Don't mail anything from the office because you will get home before it does like... 6 months. The park was bustling with wonderful activity. A lot of people around. Felt safe despite, the warnings of the  guides that at dark it gets a little rowdy. I did not venture back into the park after dark because, I did not want to put getting robbed to the test. Nearby there are several vendors who are nice"
20,"we stayed for 3 nights and were forced to take the ""package"" deal which included food.  We tried to cancel our stay after the first night but they only have a 72 hour policy.  We stuck it out with 5 hours electricity a day and little hot water.  We discoved the Jaquar Inn and Jungle Inn nearby and ate all of our meals there as the food was sub par here.  The front desk was helpful with little resources.  It's obvious that this place has seen better days, it's rundown and very dirty.  Jungle Inn is owner run and it shows.  Wish we could have stayed there (electricity all day, great internet service, good food).  Don't waste your money at Tikal Inn, stay at Jaquar or Jungle"
10,"Very bad experience with this hotel : we arrived at 8pm, got a room undone, full of insects (mosquitoes, bugs, etc).  Junior suites was a joke. The next morning we got up 3.30 for the sunrise tour : no coffee, no lights (even though flashlights promised to us). Food is disgusting and horribly expensive. The price range do not match at any case with the level of the hotel, I guess they take advantage of the monopoly situation. People really treat you as idiots, promising things and letting you down. But worse of all is that they lied to our taxi which came to pick us up to leave saying we were not there so that they can afterwards propose their own local transport instead. We heard from our travel agency that this was not the first time it happened.  So unless you have no other"
40,"I must say I'm always amazed at people who take the time to review a place BUT apparently don't bother to read earlier reviews. Yes power is only on during a brief period each day and yes someone knocked on our door each morning at 3:45 for the tour, but it was still a great time.  The rooms were nice and clean. We had a bungalow next to the pool which was beautiful. Everyone was friendly, even though probably only half the staff spoke English. We had the meal plan, which was dinner and breakfast. Gold service and the food was good. Not five star dining but you are in the jungle. You could stay in Flores for , but this helped make the Tikal experience complete.  My only complaint was we had arranged a shuttle from San Ignacia with the hotel, It never showed. No problem. We"
40,"Fabulous location. The park is right outside your door.  We were originally in bungalow 11 which is a bit more secluded but after torrential downpours (and thus electrical problems) they moved us across from the pool were you could (literally) hear your neighbor urinate at night.  Get up early, do your 4 hours of hiking, go back to the hotel, have a few Gallos, take a swim & have the place to yourself and the coatis & wild turkeys & toucans... P.S.  Bring your flashlight. "
40,"We stayed for two nights for New Year... What a superb location - yes, it's in the jungle, but that's stating the obvious!!  The lodges were clean, comfortable and perfectly adequate... There were mosquito nets over the bed and the bathroom was small but had good facilities. The lodge has a diesel generator - not the most environmentally friendly, so it's switched off overnight between 12 and 6am... We did the 4am start for the sunrise walk and getting dressed in the dark with no hot water... ummmm... added to the experience!! Whilst we were there the food was served as a buffet - the food was ok - quite traditional, but pleasant enough - nothing to write home about. Overall, this lodge is all about the location, right next to the entrance to Tikal - so you can beat the crowds"
40,"The location is great......the rooms where very clean, spacious including the bathroom.  There were no bugs (mosquitos) in the rooms which was great. Waking up in the morning there is something different.  You are able to hear the animals, which is wonderful. Something you don't really hear everyday. The service was excellent especially the front desk srevice. The receptionist Josue was very professional, and his English was very understandable. He is now a tour guide at Tikal and is very informative (highly recommend him can reach him at isaisosa13@hotmail). There is really nothing special about the breakfast.  It is a bit costly for on person, but well worth the stay at least for one night."
40,"Great location to explore the park. Sunrise tour the highlight of a meditative experience. Nice people friendly and helpfull. Menu is ambitious, execution deplorable. But the smiles of the servers help to make you forget how bad it is. "
50,"the hotel is situated in the middle of the jungle and inside the park, so you can easly walk at everytime to go to see the ruins. rooms are very basic but the atmosphere is great. this was the first place buit in the jungle for turist and all around you will make you feel an explorator!"
40,"What to expect from a lodge located in the middle of the jungle? A fantastic stay! Amazing wildlife, (even walking through the room - watch out for the scorpion!) The complex is certainly aging but it was the first hotel built in the Tikal national park when the first explorers came to uncover the ruins. You feel like you're part of the adventure and you live what they lived at the time. It's a great feeling!  The staff is great, we were welcomed by the owner and he gave us a brief history lesson about the Park and its discovery as he grew up in among the explorers.  We walked through the Tikal Inn also but we certainly preferred the Jungle Lodge."
40,"Spent a night in May 2013 at the Jungle Lodge. Due to tight schedule, this was the perfect option, as the this is the only hotel (?) located inside the National Park just few hundred meters from the entrance gate. Would say superb location!. At the garden we photographed parrots, tucans and spider monkeys.  The service was professional and friendly.   The restaurant offers quite basic food.  The rooms are spacious and supplied with a ceiling fan. They are clean, but very basic. Good size bathroom (but we had palm size spiders inside the shower - but I guess, this is part of the jungle experience...).  The hotel can provide excellent and most professional guides. They can also arrange airport pick up.  You pay for the location, not for the comfort, but in any case time spent at"
10,This hotel looks very nice on the web site but if you stay there don't bring your CPAP machine because there is no electricity after 10 PM until 6:30 AM the next morning. Then it goes off again at 8 AM. I stayed there under duress because I had five other people in my party. They pick you up at the airport and take you for over an hour drive into the jungle. Then they tell you there is no electricity all night long. If you have to use the bathroom in the middle of the night make sure you clear a path the night before so you don't trip over the furniture. Think about the food you are eating too. It is not under refrigeration for about 18 each day. I was awaken at 3:45 AM to go on a sunrise tour that I never signed up for. They knock on your door and you stub your toe on furniture
40,"The location cannot be beat.  The staff is fantastic - especially David who works as a server in the ""restaurant"".    You need to remember that you are in the jungle - and it is muggy (if you think your hand laundry is going to dry overnight - dream on!!!) - There is electricity only during certain periods of the day/night (Don't expect ice!) But they do have solar lights that work pretty well if you are getting up at 4am to see sunrise from the top of pyramid 4 (which we tried to do - but with the fog, we just got up and were cold :-(  The menu at the ""restaurant"" doesn't seem to bear any relationship to reality - but the people who work there could not be nicer.  The pool is a nice touch - the kids loved it!  Other than the park, there isn't a whole lot to do, but it doesn't"
40,"The Hotel Tikal Inn is all about location, you can see the ruins at at first light or as the sun is setting or in the middle of the day.  Its barely a walk.  You just have to be a bit more prepaired with cash on you, its hot as sin at night when the power goes off at 10pm in your room.  Then at 4 or something close to that the monkeys are loud as can be.  The food is a good, basic but good.  They honestly try very hard to make you feel comfortable.  Its no Westin Hotel so if thats what your expecting dont stay at this hotel, but a bit of roughing in and considering where you are its a great place."
50,"Great hotel in the area, not for the traveler who is not willing to tough it up to enjoy the surrounding natural and Mayan made beauty. Service is excellent, employees go above and beyond call of duty, food is simple but excellent. Electricity only between 06:00 hrs and 08:00 hrs and again 18:00 hrs and 22:00 hrs, so showers need to be scheduled accordingly as well as tours. WORTH IT though."
20,"This is decaying 1950's hotel. Rooms are basic, no charm. Service was poor. Food was mediocre. Paint peeling, half completed projects around the entrance. Recommend staying in Flores unless you absolutely need to be there overnight for early morning tours."
30,"One is getting a great location right at park entrance.  It is worth it.  But know that compromises come with that.  Beds aren't very comfortable, water pressure is a rumor.  But rooms are sizable, restaurant is reasonable, and wildlife on grounds is fun. You will be awakened early by monkeys and birds, so go to bed early.  Biggest disappointment was the fact that staff were not very friendly or helpful.  Also be prepared that wifi is unreliable...but go enjoy the park."
50,"We spent two nights at the Jungle Lodge.  As many have already said, it is the perfect place to stay in Tikal National Park.  Our accommodation was a bungalow which was very comfortable and had a large bathroom lit with natural light (although a pocket flashlight does come in handy in the evening).  The sound of the howler monkeys in the middle of the night was unlike any experience we've ever had before and definitely not to be missed.  The hotel's restaurant served good food and had a number of vegetarian choices.    The only complaint we have is there seemed to be a shortage of cash in the park area.  For example, we could not find an ATM or place to exchange currency.  We had to pay cash for the entrance fee to the park as no credit cards were accepted.  And the hotel would"
30,"...it really is, i have to give them that. all else was mediocre at best.   we expected great cocktails and dinner. so the first disappointment was my campari orange, lots of juice barely campari. but the sauces accompanying our dinner and the overall atmosphere of the restaurant made us have bf and dinner at cafe tikal at the visitors center and comedor ixim kua the following days.  our room was nice and big and clean, the porch is great in the evening to listen to the jungle but having a dozen cockroaches tap dancing in the shower (nice and hot in the evening, barley tepid in the morning) was a bit much. never mind being in a jungle climate, after stuffing toilet paper into the open door frame of the shower and covered the sink with a glas, they went to dance somewhere else."
50,"My wife and I would rate this hotel as excellent. Although It does not meet the luxurious standards of many of the safari lodges in Africa, they do provide excellent service, surprisingly good food and comfortable and clean accommodation under difficult conditions. They have the best location within the Tikal national reserve, right at the entrance to the ruins. Electricity is available only during certain hours. (Remember to take an electric torch if you wish to get dressed before dawn). The hotel has a swimming pool which we did not have time to use.  We had booked for one night and arrived at about 4:00 p.m. On arrival, we were told that our guide would be available at dawn the next day for a bird watching and ruins tour of four hours. I told the manager that we had requested"
40,"Very good clean hotel / lodge right in the park.  The staff was very good, and helpful.  Rooms were clean, with good hot showers.  Pool needs to be cleaned better.  Food was good at the hotel as well.  Would recommend a stay here"
40,Three A-type New Yorkers at a hotel where the internet service is limited and the electricity runs for only a few hours a day - and they have a fantastic time!  This Old School hotel was a perfect spot to relax and get ready for some spectacular tours and viewing of the ruins.  The sunrise tour was breathtaking.  Our guide Juan knew every inch of the park and it's history - it was a thrill to listen to him.  The hotel staff (particularly Roberto at the desk) was incredibly helpful (and fun!) it was like saying goodbye to family when the time came to leave.   The Inn is clean and comfortable - the beautiful pool is a perfect way to cool off in the afternoon.  Bring a flashlight!!
10,"I have been trying to reach them to make a reservation, but after calling several times, they finally picked up the phone without saying a word and just let it sit on the counter. (I could hear them coughing and moving around.) It seems that the other reviewers were right...they just don't care. I wish there were more options in the park!"
40,"Thus place is very good if you are wanting to be close to the ruins.  Nice big room, be prepared to get ready in the dark if you are an early riser! The room was very clean and the staff very nice and helpful!"
40,Stayed in this hotel for 1 night. Our room was very clean and big. Food quite expensive but you expect this bearing in mind the location. Good wifi and gardens.   One negative which has been pointed out before is that the hotel does not turn on its generator for the sunrise tour so you are getting ready in the dark.
30,"The lack of electricity didn't bother me.  We payed $275/night for a ""package"" that was supposed to include park fees and tours.  We rented a car and drove to Tikal. We were running a little late due to border problems but thought we might still make it for the first tour but when we got to the entrance, they said we had to pay entrance fee of 300 quetzales for both of us.  We were $2US short and the closest ATM was an hour drive.  So, we missed Yaxha and had to pay for our lunch when we finally got there which was supposed to be included.  We did go on a sunset tour with Nixon which was great.  The next day, our guide didn't have enough park tickets so made my husband but another one.  While he was buying it, he and the group left for the tour without us.  It was just as well"
40,"Spectacular tall trees fill the grounds making it feel as if the jungle starts here. It is the most wonderful habitat for birds and animals that make it their home. Just enjoying the shade of the gardens and admiring the wildlife above would make a stay here worthwhile, but of course the ruins beckon and need to be explored before the day gets too hot. The semi-detached lodges are spacious, clean and light. Any one of them would have suited us except that the paths are not so well lit at night, especially when the power fails as it did on a number of occasions in our 2 days stay. A shorter trip from the dining room after dark could be better. Service in the restaurant was slow initially, but pre-ordering from the menu for the next meal at the end of breakfast or lunch made for a"
40,"this is the perfact place to stay while visiting the Tikal site-just a few metres from the main gate. Rooms are in cabins set in a cgarden teeming with birds(toucans,parrots,mot-mots) and being woken by the howler monkeys was an extraordinary experience-not to be missed! the lighting is dim in the room but the mosquito nets are a nice touch.restaurant has no area for having a drink but the food was o.k."
40,"Was so pleasantly surprized by the charming collection of cottages set in the botanical garden of the Guatamalan jungle.  Rooms older, but well maintained, save for occasional spiders ( you are in the jungle).  Air conditioning worked fine- but some rooms are on full time and others part time. Shower clean. Food, I thought was very good and well priced. Serving staff was cheery and professional.  Location can't be beat as it is RIGHT outside entrance to Tikal. I booked the package that included local guide who was very good for both day tour and sunset tour."
40,"This was the perfect place to stay in Tikal.  Our group arrived in the afternoon and the staff was very friendly and showed us around the grounds before we booked our rooms.  We had a choice of a king bed with a shared bathroom or a room with 2 double beds and a private bathroom.  My husband and I opted for the room with the private bathroom and were quite satisfied.  The bathroom was pretty big with a large shower and the water was hot.  The electricity only went out twice, but was back on by 4am when we got up for the sunrise tour.  The lodge and pool area are also very nice."
50,"We loved our stay at the Jungle Lodge. We were pleasantly surprised afer reading the reviews to find the resturant and room beautifully appointed, clean, and the staff was professional and extremly friendly. Service wsa excellent and we got to hear and see wildlife we would never have seen had we stayed in town. The food was great and inexpensive and they even woke us for aour 4am hike to the top of the temple to watch the sunrise. I would go back and stay the cabins were perfect with mosqueto net that we didnt need but loved and the huge shower and bathroom that we definitly needed and loved. It was quiet enough to hear howler monkeys and the buzz of the jungle. Our tour guide who has stayed there frequetly has even heard a jaguar scream! It was a great price with staff that"
20,"The location is tremendous, with local wildlife at your doorstep, and the entrance to the ruins within a few minutes walk. Lack of electricity was a bit annoying, considering the price. And the food: the ""chef"" should be arrested and brought up on charges! And it wasn't just that the food was plain - I ordered the fish, which was cooked on the outside, but frozen raw on the inside. Even the breakfast of eggs and toast was gross. How in the heck do ya screw up scrambled eggs and toast?! The rest of the staff was helpful and friendly, although they should have a regular front desk clerk on duty (whoever is free - the busboy, the bellman, gardner, etc. handles the duties). Would I stay here again? Perhaps, considering the location - but I'd be a fool to risk eating here again!"
20,There are a few things that are quite annoying with this hotel and that could easily be improved if management cared enough.   It's totally unacceptable (and this is a complaint that been voiced on tripadvisor before) that the hotel doesn't turn on its generator when people are waking up at 330am to get ready for the sunrise tour for which you've paid extra for. You are sleepy and trying to shower and get dressed in pitch dark and all of this in what is probably the most expensive hotel we stayed in during two weeks in Guatemala.   You are promised and in great need of coffee at 4am before you leave for the sunrise tour and what you get is a cold drink (they put the coffee in thermoses the night before!) that is probably one of the worst cups of coffee I have ever had in my
40,"We stayed at Tikal Inn during our recent trip to Tikal. We were very happy with the hotel, food and overall service. They picked us up from flores airport late evening and made sure that we get to eat our dinner since we reached around kitchen closing time.  We took a early morning sunrise tour at 4 AM which no doubt is a highlight of our trip! The guide was knowledgeable. Rooms were ok.. no complains there.. Water was not hot so it was little inconvenient for me to take showers.. but that's just a minor point. It has a beautiful swimming pool but we did not get time to enjoy that...   Our return flight from flores was at 7.30 PM.. however, shuttle from Tikal Inn starts at 2.30 PM.. But the management was really nice and suggested to us that we can check-in at flores airport and"
30,"I still recommend that people stay here, even though I can only call it average.  The good: location is fantastic, jungle critters come right onto the lawn, power is off at night so it's peaceful, Chris (from the main office) is fast and easy to work with, transport out there is easy if you stay at Tikal.  The neutral:  Food was excellent - I had a fried fish - however, you only get two choices.  Anything more would confuse the chef, they told me. But breakfast, lunch, and dinner are served at set times. Kitchen is not open beyond that. Also, while the portions were fine, I couldn't definitely eaten more!  And the bungalows aren't worth the extra cost ... just stay in the building, the rooms open up on the jungle too.  Annoying: You need to book an all-inclusive.  We would have"
30,"The Tikal Inn was fine for our one night at Tikal.  The little cabin was clean and comfortable, although with the high humidity, everything smells a little damp.  This is not the fault of the hotel, it just goes with the territory.  Power and hot water is a little erratic, but generally available in the evenings when you need it and understandable when you are in the middle of the jungle.  The food was OK and we had no problems with the service.  The big selling point of staying at one of the Park hotels is that you get to do the sunset and sunrise tours, which are well worth it, even if you do have to get up at 3:30 am!"
30,"Despite paying for a cabin type room we were allocated a room next to reception.  It was exceptionally noisy and was dark and much less pleasant than the ones we paid for.  A request to mvoe was denied.  The menu was the same day in and day out.  The chicken was dry and tough, but the beef was OK. The staff were mostly pleasant, but did seem overwhelmed at times when groups came in to the dining room."
50,"We recently stayed at the Jungle Lodge overnight during our 2 day visit to Tikal.  We were informed by our tour guide that this was the best hotel in Tikal - and were NOT disappointed.  The rooms were much newer than expected with fresh paint, spotlessly clean and well furnished with spacious, tiled bathrooms.  We were informed that, due to diesel generator power, our electicity may go off from 3 to 6 AM - for whatever reason, maybe our judicious use of lighting/electricity during daylight hours, this never happened and we had delightfully hot water and lighting throughout.  Contrary to our concerns, the mosquito netting for our bed was fully intact and we had no creepy crawlers in our room after hrs (though we did spray DEET at the door jam for insurance!).  Our restaurant food"
50,"I had read so many reviews about disappointed people staying in the park I wasn't sure which one to pick.  Jungle lodge was a great choice for our 2 nights, which honestly should have been longer.  Beautiful setting.  Room large, airy, with large bathroom.  Bed comfortable.  Clean, changed towels every day.  We had stopped on way to bring in large water to avoid expense and inconvenience of finding/buying water frequently.  We always had 2 water bottles with us.  I love ac.  This of course is not possible in the jungle, but I was super comfortable.  The electricity was on for limited times during the day, but basically early before 6, mid day and then evening.  When generator is turned off, the back up battery worked almost all night.  So ceiling fan moved air about.  I had"
50,"I stayed during the turn of the Mayan calendar (B'aktun) in December 2012. It was a VERY busy time for Tikal and everything was ""Sold Out"". However I just went anyway and was able to score a room!  The bad side (and this is my fault for not booking in advance) is that I had to move rooms each night of my stay (4 nights) because they were sold out, however cancellations did arise.  The staff was VERY helpful in looking for rooms for me each day. The restaurant staff is also very helpful and very eager to serve. One young man was there after studying hospitality in Guat City and really had a passion for service. The front desk agents were all very helpful and sincere. Even though they were having the busiest week of the century, the kept cool and calm.  The rooms are all clean. I"
30,"A comfortable bungalow with two beds and good en suite facilities. Wonderful peaceful place to stay and enjoyed time in the National Park and seeing the monkeys, birds and crocodiles.  Helpful staff. Basic food.. Ran out of items quickly."
40,"Any reasonably clean and friendly hotel with oropendolas (birds), monkeys, coatimundis, and other fabulous wildlife on the property ranks well in my book, and this place definitely met the mark.  I stayed in the ""jungle bungalow"" section, which is about a hundred yards down an unpaved trail from the lobby. It was very quiet except for jungle sounds, which was much appreciated after the hustle and bustle of other parts of Guatemala. The bed was kind of hard but I slept really good there, which is pretty important when you don't have control over the lights (they go out at 10).  I did wake up once when howler monkeys started calling outside my room (what a rush!) but it must not have been too loud as my friends slept right through it.  The room was large, clean and pretty basic,"
50,Hotel is a very nice place and I would recommend the accommodation on it if you want to visit the Tikal! Maybe is not the cheapest but the best and worth the money option. Ask for Rony which is the best guide in Tikal!
30,"Like most people, the only reason we stayed in the park is to catch sunrise/sunset. I have very mixed feelings about my stay here. I'll start with the up side. They are very well located. The pool area is lovely. The staff was extraordinarily polite, even though at times they were painfully slow and ineffective. The staff went well out of their way to get my sick friend some local plant tea for his upset stomach. The room we stayed in the first night was spacious, well ventilated and very nice.  Now for the down side. The staff was painfully slow and many times totally ineffective. They changed our room because we had arrived without reservations and at the last minute had to stay an extra night (sick friend), so they changed our room to a small, dark ugly thing with a smelly"
10,"The only reason to stay overnight at Tikal is to take advantage of the sunset/sunrise tours, which are an incredible experience. However, I was very disappointed with the Tikal Inn. Being the most expensive place we stayed while traveling through Guatemala, I expected it to be better than the hostels we had stayed at previously. We stayed in nicer accommodations for a quarter of the price. The rooms were buggy and cold, no hot water, and there is only electricity for certain periods of the day. I get it - it's just the way it is in the national park, they only have electricity during certain periods, but when you wake up at 3am for the sunrise tour and it's pitch black, it would have been nice to have a little warning that we should be prepared with a flash light.   We where"
50,"The location can't be beat, my garden bungalow was very clean and spacious, and the staff were as nice as could be.  I went on two tours, the sunrise tour and the archeological tour, which were included with the room price.  Both guides, Ronnie and Nixon, spoke excellent English and were very knowledgeable and personable.   The pool is well maintained and a real treat after a hike on a humid day.  I thought the dinners was just ok, but the breakfasts were great and the service was always good.  It was fun to be in the jungle, so close to the Mayan temples, with wild animals all around, and also to have internet available."
40,"Based on various TripAdvisor reviews, it was tough to choose which jungle hotel to stay in while seeing Tikal but we were happy with this one. Rooms were basic but clean and right in the heart of the jungle so you hear all kinds of wildlife (we saw toucans, parakeets and howler monkeys) and saw beautiful plants and flowers. There were very few bugs at this time of year so we didn't even need to use bug dope. Food was excellent, try the appetizer with eggplant, guacamole is great but avoid steak -- it's not like we're used to in North America, the skinny cattle should have been a hint but we didn't think. The Tikal experience was the highlight of our three weeks in Belize and Guatemala, so glad we stayed a couple nights here. Pool was lovely and refreshing and service was"
40,"If you're going to see Tikal, then know this lodge is in a great location to make your time there more efficient. If you want a fancy resort in the jungle, this isn't for you. We are very glad we stayed there as it allowed us to easily do the sunrise tour, day tour, and sunset tour all in one day. The food was fine and the service good. There were not many bugs in our room, but hey, you have to expect some in the jungle!  The power went off every night about 9-10p and back on about 6am. The wifi in the lobby was not too reliable, and quite slow, but we didn't expect any Internet before we arrived, so it was okay. Definitely bring a good flashlight and bug repellant!"
40,"A simple room, but spacious with a modern shower. We were pleased with the service and friendliness at the lodge and dining room. Our guide, Antonio ""Tony"" was the highlight of our tour with his firsthand knowledge of the park and it's history. His passion really showed and we spent two days with him."
50,"Very good room accommodations: potable water, hot showers, mosquito nets. ( Though I saw none ) Good  food selection and fine service in lodge. There is a small swimming pool on site. English is spoken in reception and by most staff.  Electricity is generated on site and is unavailable during some portions of the day and night, but this is not an impediment. Bring a flashlight.  The lodge provides excellent  guides to monument sites; the early morning sunrise trek is a must for those who would experience the sounds of the jungle awakening: bird song and howler monkeys establishing their bands ' territories. There are two museums at park entrance, but only one has English explanations."
50,"Say Thank-You, & Leave a small tip...  you cannot beat the service given by Josue in reception, and Samuel, Marvin, Salvador, Angel, & Marleny in the dinning room.   Fresh-brewed coffee at 6:00AM before bird walks, warm home baked bread, and an attentive staff throughout the day!  Tikal is a MUST-SEE DESTINATION, however unlike most places that are day-trip worthy the Mayan archeological site of Tikal shows its glory each day at first-light and again as the evening darkness shrouds the forest.  STAY THE NIGHT this hotel, and enjoy the dawn chorus of birds, the chance encounters with harmless wildlife, and the majestic temples of Tikal as the sun sets through a broad red sky.  No hotel is perfect, but this destination is a mirrored image of such... treat yourself to a stay at the"
50,"I was visiting  the Tikal National Park with stoping in Tikal Inn and with the guide from Tikal Inn - Rony. He was an amazing person, who from the begining fascinated everybody about Tikal. Tikal Inn is situated in the National Park, in the jungle, so you can feel the spirit of this place, you can hear wild animals which is amazing experience!! At the same time you can feel safe, staff was very friendly, the food was very delicious, place is great and one of a kind! And Rony - the best guide!!! I will never forget how interesting was the trip to the jungle, how much he knows about the life in the jungle, the animals, the history, the Mayas and how many things around he can explain! This is the person, who is doing perfectly his job and he is really  inspired by what is he doing."
50,"This hotel is not a 5 star, but gives the 5 star experience  w/ mother natures help. Wonderful hiking tours offered as part of the trip, great animals to see right by - howler monkeys and toucans right on the grounds as well as other animals. Bring a small flash light. However you spend your time @ this hotel  you don't want to  miss the experience. Just wonderful ."
50,"Location - You can't beat the location, we were literally a 5 minute walk from the part.  Grounds - Really nice feel. Great pool, great landscaping, fun animals running around on occasion. A large number of Coaxtis (I think that is the spelling) ran right across the front yard as my dad and I were walking back around sunset.  Rooms - Comfortable if you can handle not having power aside from 6pm-10pm. This is really my only complaint (even though I knew it going in) Not being able to take a hot shower aside from 4 hours a day wasn't my highlight. That said, you are staying in a National Park.  Food - Actually really good. Better than I expected. I wasn't expecting much, but can honestly say I enjoyed both breakfasts and dinners. And great pina coladas although a little on the"
30,"Fab location in the park with a lovely pool.  The rooms don't quite match up to how the pool is presented but they were clean. We found the staff really helpful and they organised a trip to yaxas for us - few people seemed to be traveling independently, most were on group tours so the help was appreciated (id not a bit pricey). The waiters had mystifyingly good english one minute and then seemingly none the next, baffling but they were nice so it was more amusing than anything else. Sunrise tour defo worth it, the howler monkeys make it - make sure you take a torch so that you can get dressed in the dark when the generator is off. the tikal ruins are a globally top place to visit - enjoy!"
50,"The Tikal Inn provided everything that my mother, daughter, and I needed,.  The room was very clean and had a very nice appearance. -- At first my daughter was sad she didn't have the pool view, but watching the monkeys engage in their acrobatic shows in the early evening was very entertaining.  --The food was perfect.  --We love the rustic feel and knowing that we have electricity only at certain times of the day.  This has not been a problem at all.  --The staff is incredible.  --Loved it.  Already planning next year's trip back. --Have visited the other hotels.  This is my favorite."
50,"The Jungle Lodge is a nice, comfortable hotel that allowed us to get the kids out of bed and take the very short walk to the park, with flashlights in hand, to be already climbing Temple IV as the sun came out. Any grumbling we heard during the walk soon turned into ""Wow!"" and ""This is awesome!"". The place is magical! Especially if you can be there at daybreak when the birds start singing and the jungle comes alive. We had been to Tikal a couple of times before. We wanted our 6 and 11 year old kids to experience it, so we went back. It's the first time we have stayed at this hotel, usually we stay off site. Well, that won't be the case if we return to Tikal. It was great to hear the howler monkeys and other animals in the evening. Didn't hear anything late at night. Don't expect"
30,"The best thing about the Jungle Lodge is its location. Right outside the entrance to Tikal, with the ticket booth on the corner, you can't beat this for catching the sunrise or the sunset (imo sunrise beats sunset hands down!) at the ruins. The hotel itself is unfortunately average. Service is spotty in the restaurant. The food is mediocre and barely pays lip service to the fact that the hotel is in Guatemala. The guides are priced higher than what you would pay outside (I'm not sure of this but that's the impression I got talking to other visitors at the ruins). And the swimming pool is way over-chlorinated (but well worth jumping into on a hot day anyway). Despite all the downsides, I suspect this is where I'll stay if I visit Tikal again because of the access it provides.  "
50,"I wasn't sure what to expect--I picked the cheapest accommodations in Tikal and the package included all our meals and a guided tour.  It was GREAT.  Food is fantastic.  Ceasar, our tour guide two days in a row, was knowledgeable and had a passion for birds.  The room was clean and pleasant--very basic.  There is only hot water for three hours in AM and 3 in PM and limited electricity after 9pm but if you are getting up at 3:30am for a sunrise tour you will be in bed before 9pm--that wasn't a drawback.  We had birds and spider monkeys outside our room.  You could lay in the hammock on the deck and have the wildlife come to you.  We are a low key family with ages from 9 to 72.  We came to see the ruins and experience the flora and fauna of the jungle--this was the perfect place"
40,"Do not use for tours! Rooms are good and you get what you expect. Food was good and food service was good.  Do not use the hotel to book tours or transportation. First of all, their sunrise tour is more expensive than the rest. They charged us $35 pp and we saw that jaguar inn only charged $20pp. We booked w Carlos and then toured with his son. His son's knowledge must have come from watching his dad do tours. There was not a lot of substance. Feel like I lost out on Tikal. I would recommend using a tour guide at the front of the park or hiring someone else.   We then hired Carlos for a tour of one of the near by ruins. He chargesd $10 more pp than another place I found. He did not tell us much about he site. What he did tell us we had heard a less extensive version earlier with"
50,It is the closest hotel to Tikal national Park. The bungalow rooms are soo big and clean and beautiful.  You are surrounded by the jungle.  The pools is beautiful too.  The staff are extremely professional.  The food was great.  No complaints whatsoever.  It was a truly peaceful place to stay.
40,"The hotel is located in the Tikal park, and you are in walking distance to the Mayan ruins. The rooms are big with a nice bathroom. The restaurant is western-friendly (so do not expect any Mayan food!), and the food is nicely prepare. There is a swimming pool, but the water was not clean and you cannot see the bottom on the swimming pool."
40,"We stayed here for three nights right before Christmas. Rooms were large. Bathrooms was newly remodeled and spacious. Plenty of hot water. Weather was cool, but heat was not needed. Staff was great, very helpful. Best thing about this place is the fact that your are staying in the park and have almost instant access to the ruins. Face it, who wants to drive for an hour from El Remate when you can wake up, have breakfast, and walk to the ruins, which are ten minutes away. Again, staff was great. The food in the restaurant left a lot be desired, but that it not a reason for not staying here. Food in the other two restaurants in the park is even worse, we know because we tried all three. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel. It is clean, safe, and well staffed. The only"
50,"We were in Tikal a few days leading up to 12-21-2012.  It was marvelous, The Jungle Lodge tho rustic was very comfortable.  All electricity is on generator and the water is shipped in daily so be mindful of using the water and electricity sparingly and only when needed.  Protect the resources!  Be aware that the shower knobs might be backwards, hot on the cold side- after 2 cold showers i figured it out.  There is no air conditioning so the cool water  actually was refreshing after long days hiking thru Tikal.  The best part is the location, it's literally on the pathway to the ancient ruins, bring a good map with you."
30,"The accommodation is basic but serves its purpose if you are not staying for a prolonged time. It could do with some maintenance e.g. New mosquito nets, bed linen and repairs to mesh screens.  The power went off at 2am and wasn't back on when we checked out at 1pm. The hotel is the closest to the Tikal site. It may be useful to know that you do not need Guatemalan currency if you have US dollars. The food in the restaurant is ok but basic. There was a stringently controlled portioned buffet for breakfast and dinner.  Checkout is chaotic and took 20 mins to checkout one group of 5 people in front of us. The process needs to be better organised.  Tikal is an amazing site and would recommend the sunrise tour with Roxia Ortiz. Seeing the stars over the temples before the sun rises"
40,"This was a great little lodge. For $35 a night, and walking distance to Tikal National Park, you couldn't ask for anything better. The food was great, the beds were comfortable, and the toilets flushed. The only complaint was the water pressure for the showers. You literally hat to stand up against the wall underneath the shower head to bath. The power outages were a little annoying, but never inconvenient. The entire lodge is ran on diesel generators, so it is understandable. The pool was very nice, and the employees provided 5 star service."
40,The room was clean and decent sized for a night's stay. The staff were very helpful. The food was average. What makes this special is Tikal itself and the guide that I had. Nixon was his name and he was incredibly informative and thorough with a sense of humor. He made the entire Tikal experience better.
50,"This has a very nice pool!  the buildings are pretty, the staff is friendly.  The rooms were clean and the bathroom was good.  The dinner was excellent.  It always felt safe, and staff were always available, even very early in the morning."
40,"We arrived in late afternoon allowing ourselves a park entrance ticket good for the remainder of day and all the following day (it was dated for the following day.) Be aware that you must purchase the Tikal Park entrance ticket 17km before arriving at the Tikal Inn. That entrance fee is not good for the sunrise tour entrance fee which must be purchased at 4:00AM before starting the tour. Make sure you bring the park entrance ticket with you when purchasing the sunrise entrance ticket.  The staff at the Tikal Inn were very friendly and helpful. The set meals included in our package were good, the service excellent. Our guide for the sunrise tour, Rony Mendez, was exceptional! Very knowledgeable, excellent English and enthusiastic about delivering the maximum tour experience. Ask"
50,"We arrived here late and got a lovely poolside villa.  The room was tidy and clean and the bathroom good for this neck of the woods.  Do allow for the fact that you will only have electricity between certain hours (makes it all the more adventurous!). The pool is fantastic and excellent for cooling off, you also have the bonus of comedy raccoon type creatures which took a liking to pinching my fiancee's bum! It's worth staying in the park if you want to see Tikal and we did the sunset and sunrise tours.  Well worth it (ask to see tarantulas!) although very tiring. Highly recommended."
40,"Good points: the true jungle experience, watching wild life outside your door, the pool after a hot hot day, Internet, clean rooms and the SUNRISE TOUR IS AMAZING!!!!!  Bad points: one unfriendly front desk person who appeared to be talking and laughing at us with another staff member. Warm shower water but that's what you get in the jungle. Food wasn't great.  All together this was a great experience and I would stay here again :)"
50,"My husband and I stayed in this hotel on our most recent visit to Tikal, and we loved it! We stayed on one of the bungalows and were pleased with how clean and spacious they were. The food is very good and the staff is incredibly friendly. One of the high points of our trip was unwinding in the pool after two days of walking in the park.  The complimentary sunrise tour is worth taking. There are no words to describe how beautiful it is to witness how the jungle ""wakes up"" on top of Temple IV.  If you visit Tikal, this is the place to stay!"
40,"My husband and I stayed here one night while we were exploring the Mayan ruins of Tikal.  The staff were excellent, all spoke great English but did their best to help us speak in Espanol.  The shower water wasn't hot, but given the hours of electricity this was not too surprising.  The rooms did seem a little damp, but we visited during the wet season and found this with other places we stayed at also."
40,"You can get to Tikal from Flores daily but it's a a bit far. The Tikal Inn is not cheap but it's ideally placed, has good rooms, attentive service and best of all a great pool to relax in after a glorious day in the heart (and the heat) of Mayan culture.  The rooms are of good quality, Wifi in the lobby, the staff very helpful. The pool and the location are the best points. Complementary sunrise tour (if you want - but really you can explore Tikal on your own), nice breakfast and evening meal. Slightly overpriced IMHO but i'd still recommend it."
50,"I've stayed 3 times at the Tikal Inn and have never been disappointed. My rooms have always been large, bright, comfortable, and clean and the pool is a welcome relief from the heat mid day and a lovely way to relax in the evening."
50,"We spent 2 nights at the Tikal Inn and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. I had made a mistake when booking, putting down the right dates for the wrong month. In spite of this, when we turned up unexpectedly they found a room for us, and we were very well looked after during our stay. The complementary sunrise tour, with park guide Juan, provided by the hotel was a real treat."
20,"We made the decision to stay here because we arrived late to the Tikal National Park and did not want to drive on the Guatemalan roads at night.  Big mistake...  Don't get me wrong...  For Guatemalan standards and for pretty much any other Central American country, the place was really not that bad, but the price was definitely not worth the value - No bang for the buck.  This is probably to be expected since it is only one of 3 options for staying in or very near the park because the closest city, Flores/Santa Elena is approximately 65Km away.    In the past 22-years I have traveled throughout South and Central America and I have stayed in 5-star hotels as well as places that we might call ""Shacks"" back home, but for the price of this hotel ($120.00/night for a single room with"
40,Located at the entrance of the Tikal National Park. Nice hotel reception area with beautiful murals and ambience. Bathrooms were clean. Restaurant area was friendly. Excellent food service Good veggie salad and entrée. Beverages not included Rustic cabins; beautiful grounds with birds and animals roaming about
30,"The location is excellent, and the price is pretty reasonable for a lodge inside a National Park.  We loved Tikal.  The staff was fine, the restaurant also fine.  Nothing outstanding, but nothing really to write home about.  The room was adequate and I would have given the stay 4 stars, but not having electricity at night was a bit of a surprise.  I would have liked to have our fan on at night and I got up at 6 am to take a shower and was surprised to find that there was no hot water.  But we made do, and overall the trip to Tikal was a success.  If we were to go again, I would likely stay here again simply because the location is great and the price fair.  Just wish that we had been told that there would be no electricity at night."
30,"Ok, I'll start with the good: it's a great location -- right in the middle of Tikal National Park. Also, it's possible to have a decent size private bungalow.  The Bad:  Brace yourself -- there is no electricity at night.  None.  Anywhere.  Which means that everything is pitch black both inside and out of your bungalow.  I was not informed of this before I booked but I can't really blame the hotel for my not being informed since I booked the hotel as part of a pre-arranged package with a travel agency.  Either way, it was really creepy, especially since I was staying alone and had no cell phone reception (this is also an important note: there is NO cell phone reception in the entire national park except for at the very top of the highest temple.   Also, there are bugs. "
40,"We had the most wonderful vacation experience at the Jungle Lodge earlier this summer!  The staff is wonderful, they take good care of you.... and Carlos is a gem.  Carlos embodies the heartbeart of Tikal, he is extremely knowledgeable...the hike with Carlos for sunrise at Temple IV is what 16 year old teenage daughter says was the most awesome part of our 10 day trip to Tikal / Belize. We agree! The Jungle Lodge is well situated in Tikal making it extremely convenient.  We enjoyed quiet meals at the lodge, good service, food was fine, the rooms very functional, it's rustic, but clean (recommend using netting and bug spray/lotion on legs at night esp if you're susceptible to bites, like I am)  It was warm in June, but there was a good ceiling fan. Netting is key.  Awesome"
50,"When I first came to Tikal in 1975, the only way in was by DC-3 on a dirt strip.  The park is many times larger now and a single day visit is just not enough. Driving for over an hour from Flores wasn't an option so staying in the park was the only way we could explore the wonders of the park.    The Hotel Tikal Inn offers the experienced traveler a comfortable home in the middle of the Guatemalan jungle.  The service is 5 star even if the accommodations are very basic.  Be prepared to go without power after 10 pm when they turn off the generator and the howling monkeys are active throughout the night, but this is the only way you can experience the same sights and sounds of the ancient Maya.  The house guides Eddie and Juan were the most knowledgeable and friendly we have ever"
40,"Stayed for one night. My wife and I came by bus from Guatemala city. The hotel sent a complimentary shuttle to pick us up from the bus station. We waited for 30 minutes until the shuttle came to pick us up. After it did pick us up we waited at the airport for almost two hours until two other guests (that came via plane) joined us. Other than that, the stay was great and Tikal is amazing. Important to know that there is electricity only between 0600-0800 and 1800-2200. "
50,"We were very pleased with our one night stay at Tikal Inn.    It is in the middle of a protected national park, and the grounds are respectful of the surrounding nature.  So, you are part of the jungle mosaic-  you will hear and see howler monkeys and some raccoon-like animal with long, upright tails trolling the property.  The stars are simply magnificent at night.  The acccomodations themselves are basic, which is fine, since you are just in the room to sleep and shower.    The swimming pool was a huge plus, as a respite from the hot afternoons.   We had some dietary requirements which the kitchen was all too happy to accomodate, thanks to the able translating by our waiter Hubert.  The food was delicious, again considering the remote locale.  The sunrise tour of Tikal is a no"
50,I stayed in the budget rancheon room which is about a five minute walk into the jungle. The room has two twin beds and is spacious with areas for luggage storage in the room and bathroom. It is away from the noise of the generators (6AM-8AM; 6PM-10PM) and the rooms stay cooler during the day so perfect for a nap. The staff was organized and attentive and the food was tasty. It was an excellent value for staying in a national park. It was great to be able to visit the park in the morning and then return to the Inn for a swim and a nap during the hottest part of the day before returning to the park for sunset. Highly recommended. Staying in Flores and eating there will cost you the same-stay in the park.
50,"There aren't too many places I have traveled to where I truly feel like I'm in a lost world. We got a bungalow, talk about a huge room, plenty of space, a resident gecko to eat some of the stray mosquitos, and a huge bathroom. The resturant was one of the best we ate at in Guatemala, the pina colada clasico is amazing, and the food perfect. The rainy season is the time to go, there's almost no one in the park for the sunset tour (especially if its raining as your leaving the hotel) we had a total of 12 people in the whole park. After the power goes off, the noises you hear are unlike anything I have ever experienced, they will stay with me forever. Coffee by candelight for the sunrise tour, the howler monkeys, and a hike to Temple IV in the pitch black, I had goosebumps (the"
40,"The rooms were clean and the pool was wonderful. However, don't buy the water at the hotel - it is much cheaper if you just walk over to the museum and market area and buy big jugs there.  Even the water at the stands inside the park was about half the price.  If you book a tour, pay the park entrance fee yourself instead of going through the hotel.  Just negotiate the guide price. They were adding on 20 dollars for the entrance fee and it you pay in Quetzales  it was about half that at the gate.   However, for some reason, it turns out to be less expensive to pay for your room with dollars instead of the local currency.    Tip the service people directly - when we asked them, they said the tips are not passed on to them if you pay the management.  If you hang out in the pool"
50,We spent two nights at the Jungle Lodge and found it to be an excellent spot to stay. The staff were very friendly and helpful and even booked us a sunrise tour late at night for the next morning. The sunrise tour was an absolute highlight of our trip and the guide Carlos was stellar.... he made Tikal and the lives of the Mayan people come alive for us. Riding into the jungle on the back of a truck listening to the howler monkeys was way better than Disneyworld said our twelve year old daughter. Spending the afternoons swimming and watching the spider monkeys come out in the trees hanging over the pool (around 4 or 5pm) was the second best thing in our 3 week trip to Guatemala. The food at the restaurant was fine and we could all find something to eat ( our daughter is very
30,"If you want to be in the park then this place serves its purpose. The hotel restaurant is pretty average and very expensive as you don't really have an alternative, the restaurants nearby all seemed closed and it felt like a bit of a ghost town. The rooms are pretty basic which is what you expect for a jungle lodge but I think it is a bit overpriced for what you get. We decided to visit Flores on our way out and it is a lovely little place with plenty of cafes, restaurants and hotels so if you don't mind the commute I think staying there is a much better bet."
30,"Perfect location for the ruins which are within easy walking distance – it's lovely to be able to go back in when it's quiet and cool. Also great for spotting wildlife like spider and howler monkeys (amazingly loud noises they make!) and birds.  Large room and bathroom. No safe. No A/C but ceiling fan, though the power goes off late in the evening and doesn't come on again until about 6a.m. Mosquito nets over the beds. Two large cockroaches in the room the first night but quickly dealt with and no further wildlife problems, though a large gap under the door makes it easy for crawlers to get in! One afternoon we were planning to rest in the cool room after exploring the ruins when the power went off and didn't come back on until early evening so no ceiling fan – not great!  Very"
40,"It's very convenient to be right in the park so once we arrived we could go for a first walk up to see the amazing Mayan ruins. The bungalow was large and spacious with a large bathroom and a ceiling fan. It was very quiet while we were there, only a few other guests. They provide an excellent cooked breakfast and dinner was also good - strange to be the only guests in a very large restaurant. No mobile phone or WiFi coverage as it is a very isolated area, but there is a computer for guest use at a small fee. It was lovely to sit by the pool in the evening with a beer, watching the spider monkeys in the trees above. First night we were woken by the howler monkeys - which make a fearsome noise!"
50,"Hotel Tikal Inn has great service with great English speaking employees who are encouraging and helpful for anyone trying to use Spanish.  The pool is great and the bungalows are very nice. Whereas there is no air conditioning, there is no place within the park you can have it. The night sounds are quite loud, so bring some ear plugs. They have a good selection of food and Guatemalan beer. I would recommend."
40,"This is not The Hyatt or The Carlyle, so if you have very high expectations it is probably not your dream hotel.  We loved the beautiful setting and the simple room.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  We enjoyed all of the food that we had at the restaurant and found it to be a good value.  2 members of our group have Celiac Disease and we did not have a problem having our dietary requirements accommodated.  Our biggest complaint was that even during the hours that we had electricity we never had hot water in the shower.  Our stay was for 2 nights.  Had we been there for more that three days this might have been more of a problem.  The gardens are beautiful and we saw a variety of interesting animals.  Except for briefly one evening we were not bothered by insects.  The pool"
30,"I didn't think the rooms and food of this hotel was particularly good compared to the price (and compared to what the rest of Guatemala has to offer in hotels, hostels, etc.), but honestly I didn't care much about that either, because the only reason I was staying here was because of the hotel's location near to the Tikal National Park. And based on the location and the atmosphere (a nice pool and beautiful surroundings), I would definitely recommend this hotel if you're just planning to stay here as a part of a trip to the ruins and don't really care much about the hotel experience."
40,"I stayed just one night. The hotel was nice, food was OK as well as rooms. The only thing I noticed was that the room's floor was quite dusty.  The hotel only has electricity between 6 and 10 pm, so you must be carefull and consider this.   Vegetation around the hotel and in the garden is beautiful. Pool looked good, nut we didn't try it  The staff was really friendly and nice."
40,Stayed 2 days in this beautiful site. Of all the maya ruins whe visited this is surely the most finest. And the Tikal Inn is a great base to visit it from.  The hotel itself is clean and green. The rooms we had was on the pool side which is great when you want to cool of a bit. Do expect bugs however so use spray when you sit around the pool. The staf is great in arranging trips. We dit the sunset trip and had a funny guide to show us around and get us to the beautifull sunset from Temple nr 4.  The entrance fees are complex (with day and nighttime tickets) but the hotel swiftly repaided when we payed them ourselves. The restaurant has a very decent menu and  good food and service.
30,"We stayed here for two nights mainly to have easy access to the park. Basically, the hotel serves a purpose: you're in the park. Nothing more. The rooms are spacious and clean but haven't been updated in a long time. The pool area is rather forlorn and the pool wasn't very clean. The restaurant is massive but seemed deserted as there were never more than three tables occupied while we were there. Staff is friendly enough, though service seemed rather erratic at times (we were charged different prices for our breakfast (which wasn't included in the rather expensive room rate!) on both mornings, despite having the exact same thing, etc.) and at check out no one seemed to know how to do our bill or use the credit card machine. Transfers are expensive but reliable. So if you want to"
50,"My wife and I stayed here during our honeymoon and were overwhelmed with how friendly and accomodating that staff were. Our guide, Antonio, really knew his stuff and it was clear that everybody working on the Tikal site knew him and had a huge amount of respect for him. The accommodation was perfect and facilities were clean, well kept and in excellent condition. I cannot recommend this place highly enough to anyone wanting to stay somewhere near the ruins.  Andy & Tess 30 UK"
50,"Four of us visited the Jungle Lodge in May, and could not have been happier. The bungalow was really cozy and clean, with lots of space and well maintained mosquito nets. All of the staff was super friendly and helpful- including procuring a pinata and cake for a birthday celebration we were having! Access to the park is great, just a 20 minute walk to the Grand Plaza, and the wildlife came right to our doorstep, with the monkeys playing every afternoon, toucans buzzing around and howler monkeys providing a great wake up call every morning. The food and amenities were really great, especially considering how far out in the jungle we were.  The best choice to explore the magnificence and wonder that is Tikal!"
40,This was so very strange to wake up at 4 o'clock in the morning by the screams of the howler monkeys and again at 5.30AM which also awakend the rest of the animal lifes. Get out of bed and enjoy the surrounding. The bungalow we stayed at was very nice with a large bathroom. It surely was a great experience and the staff and restaurant was of good quality.
50,We found the Jungle Lodge perfect.  Yes the power is limited but you are at a jungle location and should except it.  There is no air conditioning but the jungle cools off for a comfortable nights sleep. We found the staff very friendly and charming.  We loved our guide.  You must ask for Antonio.  The restaurant served excellent food. It is priced well.  We never walked away hungry.  You should try the Eggs of the Jungle very satisifying breakfast. It is very close to Tikal National Park.
50,we stayed here one night. The staff was awesome.  The food was surprisingly delicious. We all loved the pineapple frozen drinks. The sunrise tour was difficult to get up for but you are only in Tikal once so mind as well do it but be forewarned (we found out afterwards ) that 40% of the time it is fogged in and you can't see the sunrise after you got up at 3:45 am hiked through the forest up to temple 4. Bring a flash light with you. It is a great time to see the animals more active then on our afternoon hike.  The rooms were very clean and the pool was spotless. There is electricity by generator only which is a national park rule so there are hours where there is no electricity 10pm-8am and 10am-4pm
30,"Watching the ruins slowly emerge from the morning mists, peaking above the forest amid the sounds of chattering birds and howling monkeys, was very memorable.  Even though the sunrise itself wasn't spectacular, the experience was striking.  Because the hotel is so close to the park, it was very easy to go back to the room, take a siesta, swim in the pool, and then walk back to see the ruins in the afternoon.  The location makes staying at Tikal Inn well worth it.  The actual hotel itself is nothing special - the accommodations were quite rustic.  I went into my two night stay here knowing that the electricity is shut off overnight.  Knowing and experiencing are two different things, however!  Without a fan, the hot, humid, still air in your room is almost unbearable and renders"
40,"I stayed here one night, in bungalow B11 and loved everything (my rating of 4 stars reflects the fact that the rooms are simple, so nobody should expect a luxury lodge, but I was very satisfied with my stay). The main advantage, of course, is being able to visit the park at sunset and sunrise (this is not possible from Flores), or just late in the afternoon and early in the morning, without the crowds. I did both the sunset and the sunrise walks and both times it was an amazing experience. My bungalow was comfortable, even with limited electricity (it was better not to see myself in the mirror at 3.30 a.m. anyway :)). The place is very peaceful, green (in July), with lots of birds, and a pleasant pool. Wifi didn't work for me either, but there is a public computer at the"
20,"This is a very basic hotel. It is very uncomfortable. As mentioned in other reviews electricity was only available between 6:30 and 8:30 in the morning and from 6pm to 10pm or so. The rooms are small, dark and not very clean. The food is ok, not great and not awful. The service was friendly and relatively efficient. We have been told not to drink or brush the teeth with the tap water. I was happy to leave the place after two nights.  It is a shame there's no decent option to stay in Tikal because the ruins and the nature of the rainforest are awesome."
50,"We stayed two nights.  Lovely room but power only for a few hours a day in the morning and the evening.  I had heard the service wasn't great but the desk went out of their way for us.  They arranged a driver to take us to Xacha.  It was great to be within walking distance of the park and also be in an outlying place where there were plenty of birds in the trees all around.  The absolute highlight was the sunrise tour the Inn offerred.  I think this would be hard to do if you weren't staying at the inn.  Things cooled down at night so if you don't mind a little rustic, definitely stay here."
40,"The Jungle Lodge in Tikal is a perfect location from which to explore Tikal.  You are within steps of the entrance and about a half hour from the central plaza.  This is especially wonderful if you want to take the sunrise tour, which leaves by 4:30 a.m.  That is very cool because of all the mist, animals, and birdsong.  We sat at the top of Temple 4 and watched the mist as it came and went, sometimes seeing the back of Temple 3 across the jungle, sometimes barely seeing the jungle. The lodge itself is a jungle lodge, which means no T.V., no telephones, no air conditioning, and no WiFi.  The electricity goes out every so often and the pool is a bit murky.  (I think crocs could be in there.).  On the positive side we had no problem with hot water, the staff were friendly and"
20,"Hotel was almost empty. Room was decent size and reasonably clean. Hot water and electricity erratic. My main gripes: 1. Almost zero customer service 2. Almost 25% more than counter parts (Tikal Inn) for transportation and even more for tours  3 hard sells on over prices tours  4. Above ground pool was filthy 5. Horrible stench of sulphet/sewage outside my room. 6. $30 more a day than Tikal Inn- and Tikal was much nicer with amazing customer service. 7. Wifi $3US per 30 mins 8. All around price gouging and sucky behavior. I don't understand how this hotel gets positive reviews.   I used Tikal inn for the sunrise tour- in fact - so did the thee other people at Jungle. Roxie, an archeologist by trade was amazing and less expensive. I also booked my transportation through Tikal Inn"
50,"Stay at the Jungle Lodge.  A standard room is adequate.  (Use the net attached to your bed!)  Arrange at the desk for the sunrise walk.  If Tony, the Guide, is there, book him.  Drink a cup of coffee at the lodge, before you leave.  Walk.  Walk.  Walk some more.  Sit on Temple IV.  Watch the sunrise.  Feel the energy. Follow Tony around through the sites.  Back at the Lodge, enjoy a reasonably good breakfast.  If pineapple juice is offered, don't ask for orange juice.  Enjoy fresh local fruit juice.  Take a shower if you have time.  Then leave for your next stop."
30,"We arrived at the Jungle Lodge after a two hour journey by car. Our driver, Julio was excellent and sorted out getting through the Guatemalan border which I understand can sometimes be a problem.  The Jungle Lodge is set in more attractive grounds, with toucans and howlers monkeys at close proximity – these do wake you in the early hours of the morning! The rooms are fine and had a ceiling fan, but could do with a safe to put your valuables in, rather than having to carry them around. However, even with the ceiling fan it is really hot in Tital and very humid.  The bathrooms looked new and were very clean and the towels were lovely The hotel was very quiet when we were there, and the restaurant staff do not speak much English, and seemed to be a little inexperienced in serving."
40,"Our family stayed 3 nights at the Jungle  Lodge. We found the rooms clean and comfortable, and the staff friendly and helpful.  The sunrise tour is worth it even if it is misty as it was when we were there. We went back later in the day and it was hotter and more crowded so we appreciated our first view being so peaceful. Our guide was excellent, and also arranged a zipline excursion for us. Everyone at the hotel was very helpful and friendly. Most speak some English, and appreciated my attempts at ordering in Spanish.   The lodge is rustic -- we did need to use our IPODs as flashlights to get ready for the sunrise tour as there was no light. Also, the menu is limited, but I could eat the local potatoes and vegetables every day without complaint. As other reviewers have"
30,"We spent three nights here recently, but just one or two would have been enough.  Airport pick up was smooth, but had to pay extra for the return trip because of an early morning flight time.  The room (one of the bungalows by the pool) was fine, nothing fancy but always clean.  We took the dinner, bed and breakfast option, which was average - wouldn't bother.  There was no wifi available at all, with continuous excuses from staff as to why it wasn't working.  Highlight was the sunrise tour - our guide was absolutely fantastic!  With the benefit of hindsite - no real need to stay in the park - you will probably find better food and hotels in Flores."
40,We stayed 1 night in June in one of the Ranchon rooms located a short walk away from the cluster of cabanas around the pool. The room was very clean and nicer than we expected and we enjoyed more privacy than the other rooms. We did the sunset and sunrise tours and the experiences were both so different from each other and so amazing -- do not miss either if you have the option! If you've stayed in a jungle lodge before then you will understand that the generators are only run for certain periods of the day. Just make sure you are thoroughly exhausted from temple hopping before you go to bed and the lack of fan won't keep you from getting a good night's rest. The staff were courteous and the food served at the restaurant was very good. We only regret not staying for another
40,"So glad we stayed in the park--as it meant that we were able to do the sunrise tour of Tikal that the Inn provides as part of the room price. We had a wonderful guide, Eddie, who is trained as an archeologist. We got to the top of Temple IV in time to hear the jungle wake up--was the highlight of our 10 day trip. Eddie was very knowledgable and gave a great tour. We had a cabana on the jungle side and am glad we opted for this instead of poolside. It was quiet and we could sit on our porch and watch the monkeys swinging in the trees across the yard. The room was large and clean. The limited hours of electricity wasn't a big deal at all. The choices in the resturant are very limited and the food was just adequate. The staff were friendly and helpful."
30,"The Tikal Inn is in the right spot for sure.   Staying in the park makes the most sense but be aware that this is a hot and humid place.   They have no AC and turn off the electricity at 10PM until 6AM and then from 8:30AM to 6PM.   This means no air flow, no fan, only damp air.   We lost weight trying to sleep.   The food is pretty good in the restaurant and you will see wildlife right off the front porch."
50,"Our stay at Tikal Inn was perfect, they picked us up at the airport in Flores, arranged for the sunrise tour, sunset tour and zip lining (with monkeys - so cool!).  My expectation for a jungle inn was pretty low from experience in other countries, well Tikal Inn exceeded my expectations.  First, the food was consistently great - we had breakfast, lunch and dinner there - try the papaya shake!  The rooms were real rooms with walls, windows, screens and full large bathrooms - electric a few hours in the morning and a few hours in the evening but they had a battery powered light on the wall.  Very clean.  The tours they arrranged went well, they will give you a wake up call (knock on your door) we did the sunrise tour - left the hotel at 4am but they had coffee ready for us before"
40,I only stayed here 1 night but was perfect for what I needed-easy access to Tikal for my pre-arranged guided tour. The lodge is right next to the entrance gate. The rooms were amazingly spacious and very clean. The staff were very friendly and the food pretty good. Saw a coati and lots of birds in the grounds. Unfortunately didn't get a chnace to use the inviting looking pool. I think the lack of AC and the electricity only being available at certain times shows a committment to conserviing resources-after all it's not exactly close to a local sub-station. For information-if I remember correctly electricty is available 07.00-09.00am & sometime early evening to 10.00pm.
40,"We spent two nights at the lodge in February.  If you are visiting Tikal this is the place to stay.  You can be in the park first and out last.  It took us about 1 to 1 1/2 hours to get to the lodge from Flores. I had low expectations of the lodge after reading many reviews on tripadvisor.  We found our room to be simply furnished, clean, and with a comfortable bed with mosquito netting.  What more could you ask for in the jungle.  Our electriciy would sporadically go off (usually during the night) and the ceiling fan would not work when this happened.  My husband felt warm and I was comfortable.  The water pressure in the shower was also a little low (for me).  While at the lodge the pool was closed during our stay.  However, it is on a nice deck with several lounge chairs and"
30,"No AC in a hot climate; did have ceiling fan .  Electricity was not constant. Room was clean and the shower welcoming.   Accomodating staff.  Great restaurant.  Rates were high considering, but you were steps from the ruins, and that goes a LONG way considering the walking in the hot jungle you will be doing!  Crowded pool...but there was one. Birds and animal life running around !"
40,"My wife and I splashed out for fully four nights in the Jungle Lodge, around the time of my birthday.  We had been to Tikal 23 years before, and wanted to come back.  The rooms are spacious and comfortable, as you'd expect, given the prices.  The restaurant meals are OK, though the menu is rather boring.  (The crepes are to be avoided--a gummy mess.)  The swimming pool is very nice, and hardly used at all by the guests.  Indeed, there were very few guests at the Lodge when we were there, in late January.  It's feast and famine for them, as I learned.  They can accommodate about 80.  The day we left, they were not only full  with tour groups but had in fact overbooked and had to house these other people at their own expense in one of the other, local lodges.  Then the day after"
30,Perfect location near the park entrance so you can wake up and watch sunrise at Tikal. The rooms are ok but very clean. The bedding needs to be updated and was more hostel quality than hotel. The pool and surrounding areas are well maintained. The biggest problem is the customer service needs to improve! They forgot to pick us up at the airport after we prepaid and confirmed the reservation. We were forced to book a Taxi at a higher rate to the hotel last minute. Once we arrived they told us the restaurant was still open but when we sat down they told us there was only ham sandwiches or nachos available. If they hadn't forgotten to pick us up we wouldn't have been sitting down so late for dinner!   Stay here if you want to be close to the park....but don't count on their shuttle
30,"I liked my stay in Tikal Inn. Staff was also friendly and helpful. Sunsire tour guide was very informative. Bungalow was lovely, clean and comfortable. I travelled solo, but bugalow is very roomy for two. Wireless is also available and included in the rate.  Two negative sides in my experience:  - Prior my arrival, I liaised with the manager by email in order to choose and book my accomodation. The website listed three options: El Ranchero (room surrounded by the forest), Hotel room, Bungalow. The last two, more expensive. I loved the idea of being surrounded by the forest and asked several times in my mail exchanges to the manager if El Ranchero accomodation was available and if so to confirm the rate.  In each mail costs and availability were given for the two more costly"
40,"If you are visiting Tikal, it is best to stay in the park overnight so you can do the sunrise tour. The hotel was great, the food was delicious, and the staff was very helpful. I stayed here one night so I could go on the sunrise tour, which is such a great way to see Tikal. I highly recommend it."
50,"The hotel Tikal Inn is located within the boundaries of the Tikal National Park.  Staying this close to the park enables visitors to view the monuments and nature at any hour of the day.  The rooms are comfortable and reasonably priced.  The food is  good...not quite gourmet, but definitely above what I expected of a rather remote resort hotel.  The service was good. We were able to do two tours from the hotel.  The first was in the afternoon when we took a four hour tour which covered all of the Mayan ruins.  The second tour started at 5 a.m. and enabled us to see the forest and a few of its creatures as they came awake for the day.  The park is really quite spectacular.....the best collection of Mayan ruins that I have ever seen.  Tikal can be reached by overight bus (quite"
30,"This is a great little hotel right in the heart of Tikal National Park.  The location simply cannot be beaten.  The problem with the location is getting here.  Probably 2 months before our arrival in Guatemala I booked a one night stay at the Inn along with transportation to be provided by the hotel from the airport.  I sent them all of the information they needed to pick us upon our arrival in Guatemala.  The day we arrive there is no one waiting for us at all at the airport.  We waited 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 45 minutes. I had zero cell service (even with a cell phone that gets international service) so I couldn't call anyone.  Luckily a friendly local called someone and got us a ride with someone from the hotel.  They did not understand that I have already paid for this"
30,"Nine of us requested a wake-up call from the hotel staff at 4:00am.  Nobody from the staff came, but the jungle took care of us and awakened us to the roar of howler monkeys precisely at 4:00am.  I speculated that the staff turned into howler monkeys after everyone goes to sleep, so perhaps they did indeed honor our request for a wake-up call... but alas we requested the same for the next day and it didn't happen... nor did the howler monkeys come.  The staff is friendly, but young.  They promise things they don't deliver, but you don't really want to fault them since they need to sleep too and they obviously work very hard.  The food was pretty good in the restaurant, but they could organize better.  Our celebration dinner was ruined for some as several orders never came and it"
30,"First off, the hotel forgot to pick us up at the hotel despite the confirmation in the email before our stay. That isn't that big of a deal but it was irritating after flying all day to get there from the states. The staff was apologetic and took it off the bill to be fair to them. Aside from that, however, they do have a nice pool and great convenience to the park itself which is definitely the main attraction.  Overall, not bad accomodations, just adequate enough and great location to what you are there to see...Tikal."
30,"We (family of 4 from the US) stayed two nights, mainly because we wanted to be sure to catch the sunrise from Temple IV. It's close to the archaeological site entrance and the museum, which is great. Our bungalow was clean, pleasant, and well-furnished, and the kids loved the (small) pool. Restaurant menu is limited, and for our midweek stay they were out of several of those limited options at each meal. Everybody was nice, but the restaurant was very slow and the food was expensive and only average. Because we had already been traveling a week when we arrived, we paid a premuim for them to do a load of laundry and it came back damp. They charge $3 US for half an hour on wi-fi, available only in the lodge and restaurant. Not a single towel rack in the bathroom, which really"
30,"Although expensive for what it is, this is probably as good as you can do if you want to stay in Tikal itself. It's in a great location, right next to the main entrance and museums and there is a lot of wildlife in the jungle around the building. The cabana-style rooms are spacious and clean, and the bathroom fine, but the decor is faded and the furnishings rather tired. The restaurant was deserted when we visited just after New Year and the food was uninspiring, with many items on the menu not available and some of the soups being suspiciously like packet varieties. The pool was stil closed and the staff not particularly friendly or helpful, but the local guides were excellent. Overall, you're paying for location not standard here."
30,"We had mixed reviews.  On a positive note our rooms were tidy, the hotel felt secure, and the front desk employees were helpful.  However, the booking service acted unethically when it came to charging our credit card, our breakfast that we took “to go” that morning was pitiful, and the bar/restaurant service was unfriendly."
40,"We stayed here on our honeymoon about a year ago, but am just now getting to say what a great and unique experience it was!  We were able to book everything online and was pleasantly surprised the whole day!  We have some great memories that are completely unique to the chance to spend a night in the jungle.  -After a full day of exploring the park we were able to just walk out as the sun was setting and be right at our hotel - this is the way to do it! -The food was decent and the service was friendly and informative.  We were able to arrange the best possible personal transportation to our next destination, which was helpful. -Area around the cabins is beautiful and full of wildlife. -Room was hot, but as expected. -One of our favorite parts was swimming in the pool at night,"
30,"Because of our age and responsibilities, the wife and I don't travel out of country as much as we did a few years ago. I know that things change over time, especially with commercial businesses. (Tikal hasn't changed.) Guatemala is our favorite place on Earth and Tikal is the best part of a Guatemala trip. We have been to Tikal many times, (including trips with family and friends) and we always stay at Tikal Inn, and will if we go back. ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"". This lodging isn't a hotel as such, it is group of cabins in a jungle, with a nice pool and main office with a restaurant, next to the Park. I always hate to say anything negative about Guatemala, because my worst experience in Guatemala has always been one of my Best days. Tikal Inn is not a fancy hotel but"
50,"Chris organized our stay via email very professionally and promptly. I would highly recommend purchasing the ""sunrise tour special"" that includes 3 course supper and breakfast plus a guide for the sunrise tour of Tikal. Note: admittance fees to enter the National Park are extra. The hotel cabana was so perfectly cute, refreshing pool, and excellent food/drinks. Everyone spoke English as well. No language barriers. We flew Tropic Air from Belize City to the airport in Flores, Guatemala. The hotel/Chris were waiting for us outside the doors with a private air conditioned car. No trouble in the airport. Tikal and the jungle was amazing to see and hear wake up as the sun rose. The howler monkeys dominated the show for awhile but the spider monkeys, parrots, tucans, and coatamundis"
50,"Our stay at Tikal Inn was arranged by Turansa Tours.  Everything went very well. We flew from Guatemala City on the 6:30 am flight and were picked up by representatives from Tikal Inn.  A guide provided some commentary as we drove from Flores to the park.  After dropping our luggage at the hotel we had a four hour guided tour with one of the guides employed by Tikal Inn. Nixon, an archeology student, provided some interesting details about the Mayan culture. He was also very good at spotting birds and we saw all kinds including a Keel-billed Toucan. After walking in 40 degree heat for four hours we were exhausted and so were very pleased to arrive back at the hotel for lunch. Our friendly waiter recommended that we start our meal with a lemonade.  Perfect! Lunch, included with"
40,"We stayed in the Tikal Inn, in April 2012, and liked it. The only reason I am not giving 5 stars is because its a basic place, and we were very happy to stay there, but it can't reach ""out of this world"" b/c it is pretty basic.  I spent a lot of time debating to stay in the park, or at a nicer place outside of the park. For example, the serious competition was the Camino Real which offers lake rides as well, and is half way to the park (so 30 min. drive instead of 60 from Flores).  It was extremely hard to compare prices/packages b/c each place offered very slightly different things: meals included/not; tour cost included/not. Like how much would meals add up to anyhow? take the meals included or not (scratches head - answer below). So I gave up on that.  What I can say about"
50,"This hotel is great if you don't need TV and want the nature feel with the restaurant amenities. The most convenient part is the proximity to the park and the ability to buy gifts in a nearby complex. The restaurant provided good sized food portions with reasonable prices and good quality, though I would have liked to see more local cuisine. The hotel staff was friendly and helpful. Housing was nice and relaxing and at night one could listen to the jungle (monkeys and birds, kinda in a distance so it wasn't disturbing). Overall, I enjoyed the place and anyone looking for a nice hotel with a touch of a jungle experience this is a great choice. Not recommended for spoiled American tourists."
40,"We stayed just one night at the Jungle Lodge and wish it could have been longer! The setting is perfect if you appreciate the jungle and everything it has to offer. We appreciated the very good restaurant, the meticulously maintained grounds, the wildlife, the mosquito nets over the beds (necessary here), and the proximity to the park and museums. However we did NOT appreciate the women behind the desk, their stony faces were anything but welcoming. This resort would do well to encourage a bit more friendliness from their women staff. This is the only reason we would not rate this hotel higher. Aside from that, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay."
30,"We knew we wanted to stay inside Tikal for a few days so we could have easy access to the park at sunrise and sunset.  We chose to stay at Jungle Lodge because we heard it was the best hotel located inside the park.    During our short stay, there were times that I was REALLY unhappy with our decision and other times when I very happy with it.    We arrived in the evening to check in, which was easy enough.  Though the first thing we saw upon check in was ""Pool Out of Order"".  Great.  Then we inquired about where to buy admission tickets to get into Tikal the next morning and were told that we couldn't just buy tickets, we had to have a guide take us through the park, conveniently arranged only through the hotel.  I was getting frustrated.  Then we were shown to our room which"
40,"We were booked at the Jaguar Inn for the night. We got into the park late in the afternoon so after checking in we took a walk around and stumbled into the Jungle Lodge property. It's right next door. We checked out the restaurant and were very impressed. Cloth napkins and tablecloths on the tables and the restaurant was huge. We made a reservation for later in the evening. What a meal we had! Steak, sauted vegetables and the best fries I have ever eaten. The price was $7.25 US. Hard to believe.  The waiter served a rice pudding for dessert and it was fabulous. The service was great and we were all pleased. I understand the lodge itself turns the electricity off at 10 pm. I don't think that's a big deal because you should be sleeping by then if you are going to be up at 4:30 for"
30,"We chose this location because it was recommended in Lonely Planet and the best option budget-wise. They charged us 42usd for a night with shared bathroom (before asking exactly for this room, they only offered accommodation for more than 100usd per person per night, incredible!). Well, although prices were high-season, the hotel obviously had low season. There was no double room with two beds available, all were in repair-status. The beautiful pool wasn’t accessible, because the water was so dirty and old. Staff were not unfriendly when we were there, but on the phone we almost decided not to go there for the rudeness of the woman answering. All in all, we wouldn’t recommend this place too much."
10,the minute you approach the front desk you feel unwelcome. they try to sell you guided tours for a fortune not seeing the room yet. the front desk behaves like you must stay there and you have no other choice. the worst hotel we have been for a long time.
30,"It is one of the three lodges in the Tikal National Park. We stayed here for 2 nights in April 2012. It is the furthest lodge away from the actual entrance to Tikal. We are talking maybe 300-400 yards, but it is dusty unpaved road with no shade and in the heat of the day or if you are carrying a load (in my case - 4yr old) it makes a difference. The good: booked the hotel over e-mail and communication was responsive; at the hotel itself the stand out is the big pool; room was clean and beds were reasonably comfortable.  The bad: food was rather disappointing and expensive, while the choice is very limited; no avocado in the midst of the season; fruit platter was literally three small pieces of fruit - definitely not what you expect; internet is very slow and available only from"
40,"Tikal Inn staff could not be better.  The servers in the restaurant and especially Milton at the front desk.  I made a mistake with my reservation at the height of the season and they found a way to accommodate after all.  I left travel papers behind and Milton went to quite a bit of trouble to help get them back to me in Flores.  I had a great time attempting to use my limited Spanish, but there were plenty of fluent English speakers too.  The food was good and the room was clean.  The staff is outstanding."
50,"Stayed here two nights and i can't say anything bad about this place. Room was large and clean. Restaurant served huge portions of really good food. We did not take a package deal and had the full choice from the extensive menu. The waiters where brilliant, really helpful and tried hard to understand our very poor Spanish and taught us some new words.  While its never nice getting up at 4.00 am in the morning you will be making a huge mistake if you decide against the sunrise tour. Howler monkeys screaming a few feet away as you trek through the jungle in the dark (take a torch). You then climb to the top of temple 4, about 60 metres and you end up above the jungle canopy for a breathtaking view of the sunrise over the ruins.   Put it on your bucket list?  Lastly the pool! What"
50,"Absolutely loved this hotel.  The staff is absolutely wonderful.  They are genuinely kind and gracious.  The food was great and I'm a chef by profession.  The Bungalow rooms are large, but due their open screens at the top of the walls, you can hear people next door.  Didn't bother me though.  The pool was fabulous.  Hot water is a little sporadic, mainly due to the turning off of electricity during certain times.  However, if I had been more observant, I could have planned my showers to maximize when water was hot.  This is a very remote and special location therefore they use generators for their electricity."
40,"We stayed one night to be able to wake up and do the sunrise tour and it was worth it.  The hotel transportation from the airport was a good start - we loaded into a shuttle bus after just a short wait and the guide gave us a good intro to Peten/Tikal on our drive.  The hotel was cute - nice pool, thatched roofs, adequate restaurant, wildlife nearby (we saw several spider monkeys in the front trees).  Be prepared that there is only electricity a few hours a day - bring flashlights and don't count on ordering a milkshake!  On the first day we explored the Tikal ruins alone which was fine.  The paths are clearly marked and you can enjoy a lot by just walking around the gran plaza, taking pictures, and climbing Temple II.  Seeing the jungle wake up and taking a guided tour,"
30,"You cannot expect much from the limited hotels in Tikal however this was ridiculously overpriced for what you get and the staff seemed to behave as if you had no choice but to stay there so whatever they did would make no difference.  The rooms were basic and you were basically sharing them with a huge array of insects but you have to remember you are in the jungle!  In general the hotel needed to be refurbished.  The decor was tired and there were gaps and leaks in the bathroom which attributed to all the additional inhabitants in our room.  All this said the hotel is in a fantastic location to see the Mayan ruins of Tikal and to get up at 3am walk through the jungle, climb one of the ruins and watch the sunrise and the jungle come to life was an experience I will never forget."
30,"While our drive to Tikal was nice due to a friendly driver the stay was more OKish. Although the food was good, the staff was unfriendly and made the impression you should not bother them... The room was spacious and the bathroom nice, but all was dirty and mosquito-infested. Prices in Tikal and especially the Jungle Lodge are for Guatemala astronomical. It's definitly worth the trip but I would recommend you stay in Flores (a beautiful little island-like town) and make a day-trip to tTikal from there..."
30,"Well as the name suggests Jungle lodge is in the Jungle!  Although the place is clean and our room was clean, expect some friendly critters in your room.... We had what seems to be a huge coachroach in our shower as well as a itty bitty lizzard....I told the guy at the front desk about our unvwelcome roomates, he said he'd send someone to take care of this but never did. My sister is way courageous than I am and took out our roomates (she didn't kill them)...  The hotel is the closest to the entrance to Tikal, besides Tikal and/or the Canopy Tikal Tour, there isn't much do there....There's no TV in the room and they turn off the power in the middle of the night.  You can have access to the internet in the lobby for a fee...  The food at the restaurant is good, the staff was"
40,"Very clean and  hospitable.  It was such an amazing experience to listen to the sounds of the jungle while you lay in bed at night. Great pool, but could have been cleaner. Great Margaritas! Very hot and stuffy in the rooms with no AC.  Enormous shower and bathroom, both very clean. It appeared that all rooms are seperate little houses/huts with their own bathrooms. The food was so-so. We had an amazing tour guide show us the Mayan Ruins who was incredibly fun and knowledgable (shout out to Antonio!!). We also did zip-lining through the jungle, which was a great experience."
40,"You can't beat the location of the hotel.  Located next at the entrance of Tikal National Park, I was able to get up early to beat the crowds.  The hotel was comformtable and provided mosquito nets, which is always a plus, especially in Central America.  The food was great.  For a small fee there is also internet access.  There is not much to do at night since there are only about 2 other lodges in the immediate area.  But a great hotel to stay in while visiting the ruins."
40,"This place was cheaper than our first option, so I did not expect much, but the overall experience was positive. Good pool, descent rooms. Although the service could be a bit better. The guides for Tikal were great, and that's what you need when you go here. They were positive and very good spirited. The sunrise tour was really great."
40,"Wasn't expecting much from the reviews we had read before. Overpriced because the location. But we wanted to pay anyway because we wanted to do the sunrise tour.   We were pleasantly surprised, the room was nice and the staff friendly.   Lots of confusion regarding exactly how many times we needed to pay the park entrance, ranging from 3 to 1. Every person a different story. For us, we had to pay park entrance on arrival in the afternoon. Even though we were not planning on visiting the park that day - although in the end we did visit. Then we had to pay for the sunrise tour ticket which was slightly less. We then stayed in the park rather than returning with the group (the hotel had kindly given us a packed breakfast).  The food was pretty awful.   Torn between giving this a 3"
50,"My husband and I spent 2 nights here. We had a garden side bungalow. Great food in general, all the staff are friendly and helpful, keen to help with your Spanish. It is a simple place, but with the feeling of being in the forest. Considering you're living 17km into the forest, right next door to the park, we thought it was was luxury ..... comfortable, safe, with a well maintained pool and garden to relax after exploring Tikal. Internet access available in the reception.   Strongly suggest going on a guided tour with roxy. She is an archeologist who has been taking tours for over 30 years, she will make tikal come alive for you. We loved the insights into the Mayan world, and Tikal of today. we visited both Tikal and yaxha on a private tour with roxy. Recommend both  trips if"
40,"Stayed for one night when visiting Tikal. Dont expext a 5 star hotel, but each room is an independent bungaloo which is cozy and clean, but with no luxury. The greatest advantage of the hotel its location which is inside the park. In a 2 minute walk you are already at the ruins. Energy only functions from 6 to 10 pm. Night is beautiful with all the stars.  Nevertheless, the food served is more than terrible. There are not much options and nothing is tipical. Complete disaster. Mediocre breakfast."
50,Tikal Natl Park was very slow when we went. No one was at the pool but we still opted for a bungalow facing the garden/lawn/jungle. It was very peaceful as we slept during the day (as we woke up that morning for the sunrise tour). They were also very accomadating as they placed a 3rd bed in the bungalow for us. The fish at dinner was excellent! And the waiters were super kind and gracious.  We were so glad we decided to stay inside the park to visit Tikal as the best time to see the ruins are in the morning and at dusk. We just got a room and did not purchase a package deal. We ended up eating there 2 out of the 3 nights as it was really good and the best deal of all the places around there for dinner.
20,"The place was not air conditioned, but it is in the jungle.  Going for it is its proximity to the Tikal ruins, the monkeys,the coatimundis,and other wildlife.   However, the restaurant service was terrible, the staff rude, and the food only passable.  The drinks were quite expensive and not all that good.    The electricity was turned off at 10:00 and was supposed to come on at 6:00.  Occasionally, it did not come back on at 6:00.    The people with whom I traveled made this experience bearable as we all laughed through our pain."
40,"We spent 2 nights at Jungle Lodge last week.  Given mixed reviews I kept expectations really low and just thought it was price to pay to stay in the park.  Definitely exceeded expectations.  I know it's not cheap for Guatemala but it's cheap compared to US rates right in a national treasure way up in the jungle. Our room was totally serviceable, clean enough, big bathroom, decent shower.  We all (including 2 hearty eater 20-something sons) thought food was really good, nicely presented and dining room was very nice.  There seemed to be only one waiter on duty while we were there and he was extremely nice.  The pool area was lovely and very relaxing.   Having said that, they definitely do not have customer relations high up on the list.  The lady at the bar was really unfriendly"
50,"We arrived late,but found host waiting and very accommodating.Both food and rooms were more than satisfactory considering logistic problems to obtain items for menu..My grandsons had a blast and many great memories created..."
10,The management as well as the staff were incredible arrogant - as if their business was going to well for them.  The rooms where ok - but way to expoensive.  I will recoment that you visit Tikal Inn instead - only 100 m. down the parking lod.
20,"The biggest selling point for the jungle lodge is its location. Located about a 5 minute walk to the entrance and ticket booth at Tikal  - the closest of the three lodges in Tikal (the main plaza is about a 20 minute walk from the ticket booth). From what I could tell, it is also one of the nicer properties of the three lodges.  The bungalow room was not very large but was pretty decent (it is in the middle of the jungle, so don't expect luxury) - the beds were relatively comfortable. The bathrooms were clean. Shower was hot. The beds have mosquito netting (but had holes and cuts in several places, so we had to do some artful tucking under bed for the netting to work).  The amenities were good - a large and clean dining room, a decent pool and surrounding deck, reasonably well"
40,"I liked this place, although it was not worth the money, it was the best value in Tikal. There are rooms/huts scattered around the swimming pool and an assorted range of guests from all countries, with different swimming and behavioural etiquette. There are only two-three places in Tikal and this seemed the best to us. Some people sleep outside in a tent or in an hammock, we chose to have a room as we needed some comfort. I would stay there again, but I wish it was 20 USD cheaper to reflect the value you get from it."
50,"Located right in Tikal National Park, this is a great place to stay although expensive at $95 per night.  You can get a nice hotel in Flores for half this price but then you have the hassle and expense of travelling back and forth.  Besides, it is great to be here early in the morning and in the evening.  You wont have to rush to catch a bus back.  I really recommend staying in the park at least one night.  The rooms are basic but the garden is very nice with a pool that is great on a hot day.  Tikal does not have electricy so the hotels run off of a generator which does not operate 24\7.  There is electricty for about one hour in the morning and again from about 6 to 10 p.m.  Bring a flashlight.  Ask for the ""food included"" plan.  For $5 more per day you get breakfast and"
30,"If you are planning on visiting Tikal, it is worth staying in the park, especially if you want to take an early (3AM) dawn tour. The Tikal Inn was including this tour free for those crazy enough to get up at that time - and yes, it is worth it. Dawn on the top of Temple V is pretty incredible as the jungle comes to life. This will be one of the best things you remember of your trip. And you are surrounded and can hear the howler monkeys all night. The Tikal Inn itself is composed of small bungalows, around a small rectangular central swimming pool. Breakfast and Dinner were also included - nothing special, but nothing terrible. There is a bit of a septic smell as you walk out back towards the rooms, which should be addressed. The staff is warm and friendly and helpful with"
10,"What was supposed to be a great ending to my trip to Guatemala, ending up being a nightmare.  To begin, my reservation to Hotel Tikal Inn was made in early February (for a reservation in March -a month later).  I get to Hotel Tikal Inn with the rest of the our group from the airport in the early a.m. and 'check-in' by giving the hotel my name (room was not yet ready) and immediately go on my archaeological tour.  I return from my archaeological tour at about 3pm (room still was not ready) and then decide to have lunch.  After lunch, about an hour later, my room is still not ready......ok, I then decide to go to the museums.  I return about an hour later and my room is finally ready.  When I am shown to the room, I almost fainted.  Not only was it next to a noisy office room (and"
40,"We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights during our visit to Tikal. The staff are great and the accommodations and transportation to / from Flores the hotel was on time and comfortable. There is only power and hot water available for a few hours each day, so be prepared for that. I actually enjoyed not having any power for a change, so I would say it was a plus. The restaurant was decent and the staff aimed to please. We did have one meal over at Jaguar and thought it was a little better, but it was also more expensive and took a bit longer. The best reason to stay at this hotel is the complementary sunrise tour. I complained about having to wake up at 4am to do the tour, but I was so glad I did. The park was incredible in the dark and seeing it for the first time as the sun rose"
40,"You don't come here for the hotel accommodations; you feel fortunate there are decent accommodations to allow you to stay in this privileged position, where you can be first in and last out of this amazing site.  Being here overnight gives you a far more in depth experience of the ruins and the area wildlife.  Our room, which was just across from the office, was fine.  It gets a little stuffy when the power cuts out for the night and the ceiling fan stops turning, but the beds are okay and the bathroom is actually huge with lots of towels.  We had been warned about the mediocre food in the dinning room, but actually found a couple of good things -- watermelon fruit smoothie from the bar - super refreshing after hiking- and excellent black been soup.  We didn't have breakfast"
40,"I don't get the harsh negative reviews.  The rooms are not to the standards of a world capital, but your in the jungle in a sparsely populated area of Central America.  The rooms were solid, and met my expectations.  The setting and the grounds exceeded my expectations.  Carlos, the owner was very personable and very gracious to my family. If anything, I'd suggest an upgrade to the bedding, and more typical Guatemalan cuisine in the restaurant.  Excellent place to stay for a few nights.  Highly recommend the sunrise tour of Tikal. Thanks Carlos!"
30,"This hotel is about 5 minutes walk from the visitor centre in Tikal and about 15 minutes walk to the ruins. Location wise it couldn't be better. The restaurant serves quite acceptable meals. Bottled water is available to buy and take out of the restaurant, but is outrageously expensive. Much better to walk down to the visitor centre during the day and get a supply of bottled water at a more reasonable price. No air conditioning, but there are ceiling fans. No electricity between 11pm and 5am. There is no wifi available but there is one internet computer available at reception for a charge (not too unreasonable I thought considering the location)"
30,"I am very glad we stayed so close to the ruins inside the park because we were able to do the sunrise tour of Tikal.  Although the fog didn't permit to see the sunrise, the waking jungle with the howler monkeys, birds and other animal life was faboulous.  The hotel was good although we felt it was pricey compared to the rest of Guatemala.   We had seen poor reviews on service but ours was not bad.   It is a good hotel but not for a long stay.  We stayed 3 days and 2 nights and it was plenty.  The guide provided for our tour was excellent and very friendly (antonio).  Thanks to his tips on birds I was able to see the elusive Tucan birds near our hotel room.  That was the highlight for me."
50,"I stayed at the Jungle Lodge from Feb 1-3, 2011 in one of the Junior Suites - which are more expensive but I thought that they were worth it. One thing to remember is that north american standards are not the same everywhere, therefore, if you want something comfortable, you have to be willing to pay extra.  Upon our arrival at the airport, we were greeted by our driver Jorge who was very corteous. The drive from Flores airport to Tikal was long but entertaining - pay attention to the unsual traffic signs of  the local wildlife - turkeys, snakes, jaguars, etc -- funny.  When we arrived at the hotel we were pleasantly greeted by the staff and escorted to our room. The room was spacious and had everything we needed. The bathroom was quite large also and very clean. The shower"
40,"Just stayed last week here and had a very pleasent stay!  They picked us up at the Flores Airport and dropped us off at the Tikal Inn where we went a pool side bungalow which was basic but did the job!  We had Sunrise Tour, Breakfast and Dinner included with 15 each way on the shuttle per person and we thought it was a great deal!  It was very clean and great location!  We are really happy we stayed in the jungle rather than staying down in Flores.  What an incredible experiance!  I highly recommend staying here, both bungalows and outside rooms would be just great!  Didn't see rooms inside the main building."
10,We just ate here one night.  They double swiped our Visa card and when we complained they said they'd return the money but never did after several emails.  Our card starting getting some fraudulent activity after the last time we contacted them so we had to cancel it.  The food was passable FWIW.
40,"Our main reason for staying here is to spend the night in the park. The hotel included a free sunrise tour and i really recommend going on it!. This hotel was clean and food was ok. The other hotels in the park are a little more however I don't recommend as they looked pretty much the same. I loved hearing the howler monkeys at night, it was an amazing experience.  My husband and I were backpacking and arranged this without a tour company. We came from San Ignacio , Belize, which was 15 mins from border by cab and then at the border when we crossed over we negotiated a deal with another cab driver. It was pretty easy. Overall we were pleased to stay here, the rooms were clean and service was great. The guy at the front desk even helped me by giving me the local buses info to get"
50,"We stayed at Tikal Inn for one night which was perfect. We arrived to Tikal after 3:30 so we were able to watch the sunset from the top of temple IV (spectacular) and take a sunrise tour the next morning all under one ticket (plus and extra fee for sunrise entrance). It was extremely convenient and the best way to see Tikal. The rooms were extremely basic and the howler monkeys EXTREMELY loud at night, but consider it part of the experience of staying withint walking distance of the ruins ;-) Overall I highly recommend seeing Tikal this way, it was actually cool in temperature in the morning and absolutely no crowds. For sunset, the guard at the temple let us around the back in order to see the beautiful sunset. We took a dip in the pool after our tour ended around 10:30 (was"
40,"When you visit Tikal, this is the place to go! Especially when you get up at 4am for the sunrise tour! The rooms are basic but clean. Staff is friendly. Fodd served in the restaurant is also basic, but always freshly made."
40,"We 3 arrived without a reservation and got a room no problem with bath for US$96. Room (cabin) was very nice, but almost no water came out of the shower (need CLR!) although it was hot.  The extra bed was never delivered. Drinking water was provided the first two days, but we were charged after that.  The early morning tour of the ruins with Antonio was simply awesome and well worth it at $30 each.  MInd the $20/day fee to get into the park on top of this.  The pool was nice the last day, after it was filled.  .  Meals were reasonably priced and quite good, great service.  The bus from Belize was ok, but San Juan busline cancelled our return ticket and refunded us just as we left Belize City.  They change the route, and made us run across the highway to switch buses at one"
40,"I bought a full package from the Jungle Lodge which included not only room and meals, but included English speaking tours and airport transfers.  Total cost for 2 persons, 2 nights, 6 meals, 2 days in the park and a couple hours to look around Flores was less than $500.00. By jungle standards, the room was delightful and included a full bath.  The biggest negative was the intermittant generator.  But if you just asked, they would run it for you however long you needed power.  The dining room was thatched and funky with pictures from the original dig.  One face looked familiar.  It turns out the the General Manager's Uncle was there from the beginning.  The Wait staff was VERY nice, even to rude diners and the food was unexpectantly pretty delicious.  Our guide prepped us in the"
50,"Great location and jungle experience.  We arrived in Flores on January 3rd.  The Jungle Lodge van was waiting for us at the airport.  The driver took us directly to the lodge and kindly stopped for photos of a beautiful lake and some animals that appeared on the side of the road, once we were in the park.  Our bungalow was extremely clean and comfortable. We were able to enjoy the monkeys and birds while sitting on our porch.  The staff at the Jungle Lodge were very helpful and kind from the moment we arrived through to our departure.  We had a fantastic guide named Antonio who actually grew up in Tikal and definitely knew the history, writings, and culture  of the Mayan's along with much information regarding the natural beauty of the jungle.   We enjoyed a sunrise tour given"
40,"There is no better place to stay if you want to truly experience Tikal, especially if you have limited time in Guatemala.  We found the staff to be very friendly and helpful.  The food was decent, not amazing, but all 3 meals were included and they give you an excellent box breakfast or lunch you can take into the park with you.  The rooms were not luxurious, but certainly acceptable.  The best part is, you literally walk out of the hotel and enter the park 100 yards away.  Given it's proximity to Tikal, and that all 3 meals are included, I would say there is good value here. If you are looking for a place to stay, that gives you great access to the park, allowing you to easily be there at both sunset and sunrise, then this is the place to stay!"
40,"The Jungle Lodge, or Posada de la Selva, is a cheery little hotel in a beautiful jungle setting. When they say “Jungle,” they mean it – no power lines, just a generator that provides power in the evening. The landscaping is lovely jungle plants, and there are jungle birds and flowers. With the orange walls, very picturesque.  The best part about this hotel is its location just steps away from the entrance to Tikal National Park. It’s the closest to the park, I believe – you really can’t beat the location. As others have pointed out, they do seem to use their location as an excuse for mediocre food and service. But they do seem to make an effort to keep the place clean and attractive.  The beds were OK. I’ve slept on worse. The bathroom was nice, and even acted as a clever blind"
50,"Others have commented about the charm of the bungalows and gardens and jungle quiet and intrigue. All good points. Yes, staying in the midst of it all, rising at 4 AM for Sunrise tours, seeing the Mayan Genius come awake in the rising sun, hearing the Howler tribes compete for glory and territory. Wow. And a great guide too... Thanks Ronnie! The Inn staff were also very helpful, including help getting to Belize for the next step. Good food as well. Pool was very pleasant in mid day cool off time. Tikal City is incredibly wonderful, and getting more and more restoration attention. Don't miss out."
50,We stayed 3 night at Tikal and were delighted. The staff was very helpfull for the booking to the departure. Thank Tito for taking such good care of us. The bungalow was clean and spacious: the pool was perfect.  We had a 60 $ per person per day with meals which were very nice: best hot breakfast andnice choice of evening menus. The guide were all very good and being at the gate of the ruins is priceless.
40,"We stayed for two nights, had one of the bungalow rooms by the pool. Room was clean and comfortable. Rooms don't have A/C and we didn't need it in February. We were plagued by overcast skies and hours of torrential rain actually making the room feel chilly and damp. (This isn't a criticism - the rooms are designed for the more normal hot weather conditions.) There is a sub  ceiling below the thatch roof so had no problems with falling bugs other posters complained of. However, watch out for the very tame tapirs wandering around - they didn't hesitate to slip into our room while the door was open for a few minutes! Staff were polite and helpful, particularly the receptionist who assisted us with onward reservations, making a couple of phone calls in Spanish for us. We had opted"
20,"We spent two nights at the Tikal Inn.  The facility is quite good for an accommodation in the middle of the jungle with large, clean rooms, a good pool, basic but good restaurant, good service and well maintained grounds.  But is has one fatal flaw for which I cannot recommend this Inn as a good place to stay in Tikal, their septic system does not work.  All day and all night we smelled sewage in our room.  My wife walked behind the building to look at a bird and said the smell from the ground was almost intolerable.  Occasionally we could smell the stench poolside and even one night at dinner.  For us this is unacceptable.  We want to share two other points which hopefully the hotel will accept as areas for improvement after they redo their septic system.  The limited hours of"
40,"We stayed 2 nights and had a little trouble on arrival - they had not reserved our room even though we had booked and received confirmation by email.  We had to log on to their computer to show them the email!    Checking out also had it's hiccups because we needed to leave at 6am.  We had arranged prior to pay by credit card.  But of course there was no power at 6am (therefore no credit card machine) and we didn't have enough cash!  We knew about the power situation and probably should have thought of all this the night before.  However the front desk also knew we were leaving at 6am and paying with card, so it would have been nice if they had thought of it too.  The problem was sorted by waking the boss and turning the generator on briefly just while we paid.  (The generator"
40,"There are 3 choices up in the park, and Jungle Lodge is the best of the bunch, Tikal Lodge is rundown and Jaguar Inn is nothing to get excited about.  Jungle Lodge has very good rooms, all in bungalows, nice pool, lovely dining area, though a menu thats a tad heavy and not too local, there is something for everyone. The location is ideal, and the guide Carlos a real gentleman and fun a tour."
40,"We stayed 2 nights and were very pleased.  contrary to what we had read the rooms were very clean and comfortable, electricity stayed on all night and the food in the restaurant was excellent.  We never heard the monkeys during the night.  Staff was friendly and helpful.  They also arranged a tour with Carlos that was outstanding."
20,"So as a whole it was a pretty average place to stay, food was okay, rooms were basic but fine, the location itself was fabulous for the ruins however the staff were not as fabulous. So at first we didn't think much of it well I didn't, we went to the ruins with a guide Charlo who didn't stop talking don't get me wrong he knew his stuff but never stopped and for me I got a bit bored. The next morning we went up for the sunrise tour which was amazing do that for sure, that evening we went back and my mum asked for the tickets back as we had paid for them, however they told us they needed them for accounts so were unable to get them back. We hadn't even seen the tickets in the first place so started to get a bit suspicious. Anyway we complained, during the argument things got a bit"
40,"Spent two nights here , I was pleased with the room I had , the food was very good , staff were helpful. Perfect location for visiting the Mayan ruins of Tikal , which are mind blowing. You are in the jungle , so be prepared for varied insect & wildlife . Lying in bed listening to the sounds of the jungle , particulary the howler monkeys is quite something."
20,"I love staying in places like this - you know the type?  A hotel, with no or very limited competition, located on site of its country's most-treasured tourist attraction.  Therefore, the hotel - or its staff - don't have to try too hard.  It is also very transient: no-one is coming here for a week's vactaion; an afternoon, a night, 2 nights absolute max.  The staff don't care.  The reception staff were completely indifferent and surly.  Restaurant staff were very slightly more engaged, but slow and uninterested.  The rooms are ok.  They have beds.  That's all I can remember.  You're here to see Tikal, and Jungle Lodge is well-located to allow you to do that."
40,"My family and I stayed at Tikal Inn for 2 nights in February 2012.  Although a little tired in areas, the hotel is appropriately appointed and provided all the necessary services.  The hotel staff went over and beyond the normal call of duty and no request was too much.  They even went out of their way to arrange for a cake to be delivered to our room for my mother-in-law's birthday, which was a very nice touch.  For location, you can't beat Tikal Inn.  Take advantage of the sunrise tour to hear the jungle come alive in the early morning hours, as you trek to Temple IV in darkness.  Definitely a unique experience.  Ask for guide Edin Mendez, his knowledge is impeccable and his English is excellent.  Our only (minor) issue was with the booking process, which we found out is"
40,"Just returned from a trip to Tikal. Stayed a night at the Tikal Inn to have the possibility to enjoy Tikal for the sunset and early morning visit. To stay in the park is a clear advantage, not only for the off hour visit that are more difficult while staying in Flores or Remate. Additionally the location in the jungle allows to enjoy wild life (monkeys, coatis, birds). A plus of the Tikal Inn is that you can cool off in the nice pool they have. Ask for a room in a bungalow around the pool."
50,"I spent two nights here last week.  Staff were professional, clean, uniformed, helpful and plentiful.  One particular waiter would not be out of place at a top hotel.  Rooms were kept very clean.  There is only power on for a short time in the morning and evenings for lighting, but no electrical outlets in rooms and the toilet cisterns sometimes don't refill regularly, but this hotel is in the jungle and there are obvious difficulties with what we take for granted in the cities.  The pool is the best.  The food is fairly bland, but the hotcakes and the pasta rise above the standard of the other food.  The hotel staff try to tie you into a deal which includes meals in with the accommodation (breakfast and dinner) and they work this on a voucher system.  One of the reasons for"
40,"Fabulous family run inn within the Tikal National Park -- wonderful walk to extensive Mayan ruins, right amongst the rainforest with spider monkeys, howler monkeys, coatimundi, jungle cats -- all nearby but very very safe.    Accomodations very simple, clean, bug free.  Food was delicious, water safe for gringos.  Try if you can to get a guided walk with Roxy Ortiz, a family member and archaeologist who specializes in the wildlife, bird watching, and deep history of the ruins -- as well as orienting you to the neighborhood!  Roxy also took us shopping, brought behind the scenes with local weavers and woodworkers, helped us negotiate good buys. She's exceptional.  Don't miss the sunrise walk from atop a Mayan temple, 180 degree view, hear the rainforest come to life.   Note that"
40,"We enjoyed our stay at Tikal Inn. Our room was a bungalow with a double bed and two twins, which was nice for our 11 & 14 yr old boys. There is only electricity for a few hours in the morning and again in the evening. Not a big deal for us but it might bother some. Just bring a flashlight or headlamp. The room was clean and comfortable. The restaurant served us breakfast, lunch and dinner. The food was ok...but not spectacular. The people were very friendly. We saw a lot of birds, lizzards, bugs, foliage, a snake, and other wildlife around the hotel. The rooms are screened between the tops of the walls to the roof so you can hear other people in their rooms getting ready for the sunrise tour. My only complaint is I had inquired and made reservations via e-mail for my family and"
50,"We had a great experience at the Jungle Lodge. First off, our airport transfers, tour, meals, and room were exactly as they had been described to us.   The setting is spectacular, the food in the restaurant was abundant and delicious, and the room was spacious and clean. The pool was clean and delightful, and we could view spider monkeys from our poolside seats.   We enjoyed the TV in the restaurant because everyone was watching the World Cup together. It was an exciting global experience.   On the day we arrived, I became ill while climbing the pyramids (empty stomach and not used to the heat) , and the staff readied our room early so I could lie down. This gesture was at the request of our tour guide, Carlos, who was very knowledgable and helpful.   It was wonderful to be able"
10,"We were very disapointed with the Jungle Lodge, the stay started badly when the transfer from the airport we expected never turned up and we had to get a taxi. It emerged that despite us having e-mailed to confirm the booking, they had not processed it. This set the tone for the rest of the stay, the service was consistently bad, so was the food. The accommodation, pool and location are great but it feels like they know this and just don't bother to make an effort with anything else."
20,"Dear Fellow Visitor to Tikal,  We stayed at the Jungle Lodge, Tikal, Guatemal, arriving March 28, 2010, and leaving March 29. The room was nice. The food was OK.  We liked the guide.   But despite paying $150/night, the restaurant would not fill our water bottles, insisting that we buy fresh water bottles. We were a profit center, rather than guests, was our feeling.     But the real problem was transportation to the Flores Airport. We had a special (not run by the hotel) 5 p.m. van coming to get us, arranged for by the Atitrans office in Antigua. We asked the hotel to check with Atitrans on the morning of 3.29.2010 to make sure it was coming. The desk person said it was coming.   As it turned out, it did not come, and at the last minute we had to pay $60 cash - no receipt - to"
20,"The only good thing about this hotel is it's location, right at the entrance to Tikal.  And staying nearby is a great advantage as you get to do a tour early in the morning before the day trips arrive from elsewhere.  Also, I have to admit, the food was fairly OK, having expected much less from other reviews on here, but nothing special. We were almost the only people staying there, so the staff were clearly bored but rather than getting enthusiastic and excited to serve their few customers, they all moped around with attitudes!    On the first night, we tried to be helpful and order something simple on the menu as we arrived just as the kitchen was about to close, but not sure why we went out of our way when they never did!   The worst part was, after the waiter had pointed out"
20,"I thought that we should stay close to Tikal since our children are young, 6 and 8.  The jungle lodge seemed like a logical location since it was highly rated.  The rooms were clean yet very small.  The pool was a great time for the kids and very clean.  A tour of Tikal was arranged by the hotel.  I am sure that the guide was very well liked in Tikal as he stopped often to speak to the locals and to get Gallo at the refreshment stands.  I do not think that his goal was to educate us on the wonders of Tikal.  I was very disappointed with the tour and once we returned we bought a guide book and went back latter that night with the kids to do some exploring on our own.  The restaurant was very basic.  The second night we were there we went to another lodge since they would not turn"
10,"This hotel is banking on the fact that you have no other options this close to Tikal to choose from.  As a result, they don't care... they don't care about you, and they will rip you off every chance they get.  The food is barely edible, the staff are unfriendly, the rooms are sparse and uncomfortable.  Everything is listed in dollars, but the bill arrives in Quetzales... they apply their own special exchange rate based on you being 100km from anything else.  Stay away if you can."
10,"I would not stay here again. The restaurant food is very expressive and food quality is low and service is slow and unprofessional.  Lunch was 300Q for two of us. used to paying 180-200 for good food. Nacho cheese had squeeze cheese. When we returned it and asked for real cheese, they said ok. then they did not return. We then had it on our bill and when we asked for it to be removed from our bill, they argued with us. next morning we ordered cafe latte's and they brought us american coffee. they said the machine was broken. so we switched to lemonade with soda and they said they were out of soda. so we switched  to lemonade  with water, they said they were out of  lemonaid.  We asked for our bags to be take out of storage and the guy pointed to the baggage storage area. we went"
20,"We just stayed there after a long day at Tikal...location couldn't be any better and we went for convenience.  Tikal is a trek in to the jungle and there isn't another close hotel option.  But the room was shabby and overpriced with an uncomfortable bed and no more than a trickle of water in the shower.  The meals were included in our plan, but they didn't tell you it only included a couple of options from their menu, everything else was extra $$.  The airport shuttle service was great, although they stop off at a local market to sell you stuff (I'd guess all the shuttles do, and it supports the local economy which is great).  To make a reservation required multiple emails, wire transferring money to their bank in Miami, and they STILL messed up our reservation, wanted to charge"
30,"It was a bittersweet experience. The location could not be better. Tikal's entrance is on Jungle Lodge's doorstep, but you soon realise that that's the only thing you're paying for. The rooms are large and nice, and although showing a bit of wear are well furnished and clean.  The receptionist had excellent English and was very nice, but the experience was tainted by a few cons:  - We were told that laundry was free, so we put all our dirty clothes in to be washed. The next day when we collected the laundry, they'd changed their minds and told us we would have to pay $12 to get our clothes back! It was due to ""a different woman doing the laundry that day"" - not our problem, they could have warned us and because we were already paying the high price of $100 for the room, we saw"
30,For what you pay you dont get any luxury etc. We arrived late at night and were met with a incompetent reception staff. Although spending the night in the jungle and getting to WALK to the ruins before sunrise was worth every penny. Its not about the hotel but the location.
40,"As with any tourist destination you are held captive to what is available.  All things considered this is a good choice if you are staying at Tikal.  Food is good. (I would suggest not getting the meal plan as there are a few other choices close to the park and you might want some variety if you are staying for more than a day)  Hotel offers a shuttle service from airport for a very reasonable cost. For the people who are complaining keep in mind this is a hotel in the middle of the jungle, hours from the closest big city."
40,"We stayed one night in a bungalow facing a clearing, with the rain forest around it. We sat on our porch and watched wild turkeys and coatimundis (cute raccoon-like animals), and heard birds and monkeys. My husband got up early and saw 25 different birds right in the parking lot. The room and the food were fine. My only complaint is that the times when electricity was on were somewhat unpredictable compared to the schedule we were given. The archeological tour on the day we arrived was excellent, and the temples just amazing. It was a fantastic experience. Try to book Roxy Ortiz as your tour guide--she has a wealth of information and makes Mayan sites come to life, and shows the connections between the past and the present (she took us on a tour of another Mayan site, Yaxha, but"
40,"The hotel is a bit pricy, but the location is just outside of Tikal (you don't get much choice in this area).  We stayed in a pool-side bungalow.  The room is a little outdated, and water and electricity stop after 10pm (there is one battery light in the room, but you may still need a flash light).  The atmosphere is very calm, and staff members are super helpful.  Dinner and breakfast were included, and a free sunrise tour was offered."
50,We had a bungalow facing the jungle. It was clean and comfortable. The staff was so nice and helpful. At 9:00 pm all the lights go out and all you can hear are the animals in the jungle moving around. It was so dark we could not see our hands in front of our face it was so cool. We went outside to sit on our porch and could see the stars and the firefly's light up the jungle. It was an awesome experience.
30,"We stayed one night at Tikal Inn in the cheapest double room, which still was VERY expensive for what we got. Since the hotel is one of three in the park, they can get away with these outrageous prices. The room itself was what we expected--very basic. The hotel restaurant had good food but the portions were small and the prices were very high compared to other comparable restaurants in Guatemala or Belize. Internet was very weak. We opted for the sunrise tour, but were annoyed that we got up and arrived on time at 4:15 only to wait until 5:00 before the group left the hotel. The guide however was incredibly knowledgeable and did not rush us at all. Tikal Inn would have been okay for half the price. Next time we'll stay in Flores and take the bus early to Tikal."
40,"We stayed at the Jungle Lodge for one night on December 28th. Upon being assigned our room at 4.30pm we found a nicely appointed room with out towels, soap etc with the maid's cleaning toold parked in front of the door. At that time of the day one would expect all rooms to be done and fully stocked. We ate at the restaurant for dinner and breakfast - the food was fair with service a bit on the slow side. Let's not forget that the Jungle Lodge is at a remote location so given this it would deserve a 7 out of 10 rating but far lower if not at this location. Besides the Jungle Lodge there are a few other places located near the Mayan site but I am sure quality will not vary much. This is a place where people come for 1-2 nights and move, therefore managing property and keeping the"
30,"- Touristic feel with staff that made you feel a bit scammed. - Recommended not to book a package deal, which they will try to sell you initially. They do offer just rooms (after the third or fourth email) - Not many bugs in the room (surprisingly, since in the middle of the jungle) - We stayed in the shared bathroom rooms, which were esentially a 3x4 m concrete room with one window. Clean sheets. Single beds.  - Perfect location for discovering Tikal early in the morning before the crowds - Make sure to do some research on the guides. Jungle Lodge guides did not impress us (expensive and avoiding questions, we felt ripped off), the tour essentially consisted of following the guide around the park, being left to ourselves at interesting locations without background info.

40,"There is no doubt that the Westin Camino Real is a much better hotel in every respect. However, you just can't beat the Jungle Lodge when it comes to location - it is located inside Tikal National Park and this makes it all that much easier to visit the ruins.  It also makes it possible to visit the park for the sunrise tour that leaves very early in the morning and once that is done you have the park all to yourself before the big waves of tourist arrive. I recommend staying here when you go visit Tikal National Park but then moving over to the Camino Real to visit all the other sites that are in the area. The rooms are simple, the shower we had was clogged and had very little pressure. The restaurant menu is boring -but there is no other place to eat. When we were there they"
50,"This hotel was absolutely wonderful for us!  We were thrilled to be in the middle of the jungle, just steps away from the entrance to Tikal.  Our room was clean, we always had hot (yes, hot!) water and the location couldn't get any better than this.  The pool was clean and the property was well maintained.  There was even internet service available for a small fee if needed.  We had the opportunity to hike Temple IV with our 3 sons at sunrise and it was one of the most amazing experiences of our lives.  The hotel packed breakfast for us (sandwich, fruit, crackers, water and banana bread) since we wouldn't be back in time to eat at the hotel.  We could not have asked for anything more during our stay.  It was great!"
50,"You know, I tried to resist reacting to some of these reviews because I know you just can't please everybody.  But for the sake of those of us who find it increasingly difficult these days to seek out destinations untouched by the Vegas syndrome, I feel I must call out these so called advenTOURISTS.  So let’s set it up for you just the way you like it.  First bring in the bulldozer to clear out those pesky mosquitos and loud _ss howler monkeys.  Second, convince Donald Trump to build a nice high-rise overlooking the ruins so you won't even have the leave the comfort of your a/c room to view them.  And last but not least, we need some entertainment so let's gut out the temples for casinos and throw in a few strip clubs around the newly paved state of the art facility.  I still"
40,"Perfect location at the Tikal National Park, if you want to watch the sunrise and sunsets from temple IV.  The rooms are spacious.  Electricity is only available at certain times.  The hotel staff let you know about it ahead of time.  Food is OK for vegetarians.  The place is pitch dark after sunset.  So, make sure to have a flashlight.  The howler monkeys are particularly loud in the mornings - natural alarm clock. The hotel staff was very helpful in arranging our return trip to the Belize border by taxi.  Rooms are expensive for Guatemala."
40,"The 3 of us stayed in the Junior Suite with a jungle view for 2 nights with a meal plan.  We decided to spend a bit extra on a Junior Suite and to have two queen beds (as described on hotel website http://www.tikalinnsunrise.com/lodging ), but as it happened our unit B13 had two double beds and one single bed. The room was very basic, with just 1 nightstand and no other furniture, but very spacious and clean. The dinner had enough options to satisfy most travelers. If you prefer to have bread over corn tortillas with your dinner ask your waiter when placing your order.  We tried pancakes and eggs for breakfast and both were delicious. The booking was easy to make with prompt and informative emails from the Tikal Inn staff. There are two computers in a main lobby for"
20,"We stayed here for one night and left despite paying for three nights. The bathroom was filthy and the pool full of screaming kids in the afternoon when we wanted to sleep. But my real problem was that no one there was senior enough to let us find another person to take our place (another hotel in the park turned people away that day as it was full) they told us to speak to one of the owners who they claimed could not be contacted by phone or email until 6pm. I think the fact that says it all about their idea of service was that at no point did they ask us why we wanted to leave!  Stay at jaguar inn instead, nicer and cheaper."
40,"Stayed in a Garden Bungalow here in mid-December. The bungalow was very clean and spacious and we had plenty of hot water (when the electricity was on of course), but it is really the location (rather than the facilities) that makes this hotel special.  Of the hotels in the park, this one seemed more hidden away than the others and we saw plenty of wildlife on site. We only emailed the hotel to check on availability the day before we arrived, but they had plenty of rooms available. It’s probably best to word your email enquiries carefully as on arrival we were pretty much told that we had to take their breakfast and dinner package because that is what they had quoted us for in the email – I hadn’t actually asked for this package!  The hotel offers a complimentary sunrise tour"
30,"There are only three hotels in the park itself, so they don't have to try too hard.  We tried for the Jaguar Inn but it was fully booked, and the Jungle Inn was too expensive.  So we stayed at the Tikal Inn, which was very expensive by Guatemalan standards, but the location in the jungle is everything.  We booked the dinner and breakfast package, which I would not do again.  Breakfast was OK, but the dinner was pretty bad.  The next day we ate lunch at Jaguar Inn, which was much better. The room (bungalow type) was clean, but had little charm.  The limited electricity was an annoyance, but fortunately it was not too hot when we were there, and so the lack of the fan was was not as much of a problem as it could  have been.

We finally opted for the fist night in Tikal and chose the Jungle Lodge because it is the only place that has electricity all night so we at least had the ceiling fans. We were very pleasantly surprised when we arrived to find nicely appointed - and it seemed, recently updated - rooms and bathrooms. The cottages were very clean, the bathrooms were great and altho the electricity goes off for a couple of hours in the afternoon, it was on all night and gave us enough air to be able to sleep comfortably.  The restaurant is very clean and airy and the food was fine - not the best we had on the trip but certainly acceptable - we ended up"
30,"If you are a nature lover, this is the hotel for you. Right in the middle of everything and at the entrance to Tikal National Park. You see nature, animals, everything. Great service, great knowledgeable guide. Rooms are ok- no TV, a fan that works sometimes (because of the generator) and the bathrooms are clean. Food is ok- better for lunch and dinner, breakfast was mediocre. The pool was a disappointment, it was closed for the rest of the season. :Like I said, great for nature lovers, I am not one of them...."
10,"If you like dirty towels and sheets, unclean rooms and disgusting food, this is the place for you. The only good thing was the staff who were sympathetic to the guests who they knew were being ripped off."
10,"Beware of serious bed bug and mosquito problems here. No nets are available here, despite being in the in the middle of malaria season. Included with the room ,however, is an army of hungry insects awaiting unsuspecting travellers at this overpriced (the highest priced at Tikal) and incredibly uncomfortable place.We will be seeking medical attention now that we are back in Antigua, since we are smothered in swollen bed bug welts and mosquito bites and are unable to do anything but scratch ourselves like maniacs. What a miserable place to spend your Tikal vacation. PS- We management denied having bedbugs when confronted."
30,"This is one of the three places in the national park. Cant beat it in terms of location. We checked out the other two and Jungle Lodge is definitely the best. We had a room with a private bath and overall it was nice and tidy. The price was deinitely on the higher end (USD 100/night) but the location makes it well worth it because you can get into the park at 6am as soon as it opens and way before the crowds come in at around 8-8.30 am.  If you are a light sleeper, the howler mokeys can be a bother."
30,"The hotel is close to the jungle and walking distance from he ruins, its easy to do sunrise and sunset tours by staying in the jungle. They have their own restaurant with decent food, and Internet access. Electricity is available from 6-10pm and 6:30-8am. The odd hours make it a tad difficult to shower especially if you do sunrise tours, unless you don't mind showering in cold water. It is impressive to find such good amenities in a place in the jungle. Prices are very reasonable, we got a room for 60 USD per night. My only complaint was mosquitoes. It is expected to have mosquitoes, but that combined with lack of electricity at night made me a feast for mosquitoes, and feast they did, on my ankles and hands, and one even got inside my top and bit me on my back. That was the"
50,"I can't say enough great things about our stay at the Tikal Inn! To name just a few: The location couldn't be better.  It's right next to the park...surrounded by wild life. In our two day one night stay we saw  spider monkeys, Pizote, Agouti, and many different birds all on the property. Large clean rooms, friendly staff, excellent service, great food, nice pool, and a great value. We absolutely loved our guid Ronnie!! Hands down the best tour guid we've ever had! Wish we could have stayed longer."
50,"Hotel is located in the very heart of the jungle. The facilities were impeccable and the staff was friendly and attentive. I think the best part of staying there is that you don't need to go looking for the wilderness, it's right there. Howling monkeys, pizotes, wild turkeys and parrots of every color. It's incredibly beautiful. Do bring a lantern and lots of mosquito repellent.  As other travelers have recommended, make sure you get Roxy Ortiz as a guide (she lives at Tikal Inn). She is amazing. Three weeks after our trip we're still talking about all that she taught us. She is not only knowledgeable but an amazing story-teller. Kept us engaged and absolutely fascinated. We're already planning our second trip to El Mirador with her."
40,"The complementary tour offered by ""Hotel Tikal Inn"" may be one of the best tours we have ever had. Our tour guide, Edin mendez, a student of archeology displayed his passion and vast knowledge on Tikal in a tour that was supposed to last 4 hours but stretched into 5.5 hours. Its rare to find a tour that goes beyond the data dump summarized in most travel guides but this tour did hands down. Details, dates, explanations of the mayan calendar and hieroglypic's as well as a easy going, friendly delivery made this one of those tours we will remember.  The hotel is basic but clean, the food was nothing fancy but good and the pool (which we had thought was something we would not likely use)was a super treat given the temps and humidity. The hotel is also separated from the parking lot"
50,"The hotel is very clean, food is really good, and service is excellent. Rooms are between $45 and $60 (may change with seasons), and worth every $. There is a pool and complimentary internet service. Power is on 6pm - 10pm, but there is a led flashlight in every room that provides sufficient light, and can be taken out and used outside. The park is incredible (fee is $20), and it is really worth hiring a guide. Ask for Edin Mendez Rion-he was amazing. He arranged for a truck to take us up, and was extremely nice and knowledgeable. Perfect place to rest and relax..."
30,"Stayed at the Jungle Lodge for one night as part of a two-day package deal through EnjoyGuatemala.com. Location can not be beat - you are a stones throw from the entrance to the ruins, great birdwatching, howler monkeys, etc. The service was just okay and the food was passable but definitely nothing to write home about - it bothered me that the food prices were listed in dollars for some reason! Ate lunch on the 2nd day at the Imperio Mayo comedor on the other side of the entrance and wished we'd ventured down there for dinner as well - delicious food at a fraction of the prices at the Jungle Lodge! Don't be fooled when your tour guide tells you these places might be dirty, I think they just get a kickback from the Jungle Lodge :) The room was okay - clean but not in really good"
40,"The Jungle Lodge is only a mediocre hotel, but the location really does make up for pretty much every complaint we had with the hotel itself.  We had been there only a few hours when a large troop of howler monkeys came through the property and right over our cabin.  We would see spider and howler monkeys every day of the three days we were there, and an excess of other wildlife on the lodge grounds themselves - parrots in the trees, coatis roaming the paths, agouti lurking in the gardens, turkey everywhere.  We stayed at the Jungle Lodge three days, longer than most who come only for the ruins, because we wanted time for birding the park.  The lodge was perfect for our stay, we could walk out the door at 5am and be immediately in the forest.  Do not be misled about the"
40,"Overall, we liked the Jungle Lodge.  It is the nicest place to stay in the Tikal Park.  We got to see a lot of monkeys and other animals.  It was a plus to be able to be the first people in the Park at 6 am.  The problem we had was with the so-called package deal.  We paid an extra $18 for breakfast on top of paying for the room which was $40.  We naturally assummed that it was going to be a buffet because of the cost.  However, we were only to able to pick one item from the menu which was not worth $18.  It would have been much better to pay for the room only, and pay for the breakfast on our own.  After explaining the situation to the staff, the situation was taken care of.  If the management tries to offer transportation, food, etc as an all-inclusive deal through an email,"
10,"Dear readers,  we had (as always) checked guidebooks and tripadvisor before choosing our hotel in the Tikal area. Though travelling around for a few years, we had never had a real disappointment this way. Even some hotels that had bad reviews on Trip Advisor didn't show as that bad after all.  But Jungle Lodge was different - but not for the better.  I had used the hotel's online reservation service three days before our arrival - it showed no problems and told us that the booking was fine. Unfortunately I had to do this at an internet cafe, therefore I was not able to print out a receipt. Afterwards I waited for a confirmation email - but nothing came. As this has happened at other hotels sometimes, i wasn't too worried. One day before arrival I wrote another email - but no"
50,"We showed up at the Jungle Lodge with a tent hoping to camp in the Tikal National Park.  It cost us about $4 US per person per night...great deal!   It was a great place to camp with clean bathrooms and showers, and even comedores for food and bottled water nearby.  Bring earplugs;  the howler monkeys get very loud at night!"
40,"The hotel is clean and nice and the food was surprisingly good. Note: bring a flashlight! There is only power in your room for a limited few hours. Entrance to the park is $45, which seemed steep and that's without a guide. One full day in the park is enough,as there is NOTHING to do in the area other than see the ruins, We flew out the following morning."
50,"We are coming to the end of our stay at Tikal Inn at the National Park in Guatemala. We have had an amazing time, especially the sunrise tour with our guide from Tikal Inn, Ronnie. We arrived in the park at the top of a Mayan Temple to witness an astounding sun rise and hear the jungle wake.    If you go, do not foget your 250 Quetzales, and enough cash to last your stay because there are no ATMs in Tikal National Park."
40,"The grounds are beautiful and the service personal.  I would recommend not staying in bungalo B-8.  It is too close to the kitchen and all the foot traffic passes by.  The staff is terrific and the sunset from temple 4 is stunning.  Be sure to walk the grounds, it's like a tropical garden.  There was even a troop of spider monkeys."
50,"The Inn is conveniently located in the Park, we could hear the jungle noises from our bed, early in the morning. Howler monkeys, numerous different birds made it an incredible experience. The best part however, was booking a private guided tour to the Uaxactun ruins with a professional archeologist, Roxy Ortiz, at tikal_roxy@yahoo.com  She is extremely knowledgeable, very pleasant, has excellent English and her prices are very reasonable. She offers many different guided tours to archeological sites in the Mayan region.  Definitely made the jungle experience a lifetime memory!"
40,"My reviews of this Inn have to be viewed in the context of other options available, and on a relative scale given the remoteness of Tikal.  I stayed two nights in the Inn in a poolside bungalow and would recommend these rooms.  The bungalow rooms are spacious and clean, the room was serviced each day, the bath towels were large (if not of industrial strength) and a new large bottle of H2O was provided at no add'l charge.  I also had the well kept, refreshing pool right outside my door, plus you are very close to the main entrance to the park. They are trying very hard to provide a great experience in a very remote location and the service was quite good.  I even saw the servers and desk clerks going through team building exercises together (seriously!) and spoke with one of the"
40,"Here's the deal. You get to stay in the park, footsteps away from the entrance to Tikal National Park. That's what you have to keep in mind. That's worth alot because the buses roll in around 7:30 or 8:00, but you can get into the park right when it opens at 6:00 am (earlier, I guess, if you are sneaky).  Now, the rooms are actually pretty good. The food is overpriced (American/European prices). And they try to nickel and dime you for every possible thing. For example, a domestic call is 8Q per minute (or about $1 per minute)! The staff acts like their only job is give you your room.  They are overwhelming unfriendly and have no service-oriented nature whatsoever. So different than other parts of Guate.  Probably the worst attitude I experienced in all my time in Guate.  But, on"
40,"As the title implies, this is a fine place to stay when visiting Tikal.We stayed for 2 evenings and the overall experience was very good. The food was excellent , and do try the Gallo beer, which is a very fine beer in my opinion.  The rooms were situated in a way which is perfect to enjoy the sounds of the jungle. They were clean and fairly comfortable. The water pressure in the shower wasn't very high, but I suppose its good not to use too much water. Yes the generator is loud if your room is nearby, but I found that I tuned in to the sounds of the jungle nonetheless. I booked through Katie Valk and would recommend  her to others looking to visit Guatemala or Belize. Every part of the trip went exactly as planned."
40,"We stayed at the Jungle Lodge for 2 nights and it was absolutely terrific. All the bad press about the food did not bear out for us as our meals were included and all were great. A few times they ran out of basics like tortillas but considering it is the middle of nowhere we were happy to overlook that. Our room was spacious with a gigantic bathroom. Just out our door we could watch hummingbirds and toucans and the elusive little agouti scamper around the grounds. They use a generator to generate electricity a few hours each day and while loud, it was not a major detraction. We swam at the pool every day. It was particularly refreshing after a long hike to see the ruins. The pool area is clean and centrally located with great opportunities to spots birds from the lounge chairs. "
40,"My son and I stayed in one of the bungalows (Building 6) which had a great bathroom and comfortable beds. It was warm in the room...83 degrees with the fan going at 10pm. We asked not to be close to the pool and were not bothered by any unpleasant odors nor the generator. (Do bring earplugs in any case when you travel to Guatemala, with the dogs, roosters, etc., you’ll need them for peaceful sleeping). It was great being so close to the entrance at Tikal. We got up around 5am so that we could enjoy the sunrise from the ruins. Be sure to bring candles/flashlights, there is no electricity in the room before 6am. I brought these small, lightweight portable lanterns by Coleman from Target that worked great. Also put on your DEET before you exit the taxi or van when you arrive at the"
20,"As everyone else has said, the location of Jungle Lodge is superb right at the entrance of Tikal and enables maximum experiences in the park itself.  However, outside the location and the nice ambience of the lodge, it has little going for it.  The food was the worst we had in Guatemala.  Our first night there was a huge group staying with us and the food was buffet style.  It was bland, American style cafeteria food and was seriously worse than my dorm food at college.  The food improved slightly after the group left and we could order a la carte but it was still bland American food.  We did not get one tortilla while staying three nights even when ordering the Guatemalan specials!  We were also very disappointed with the customer service.  We had paid for a package deal which"
40,"We LOVED this hotel, it was absolutely worth it to stay at the park, you need an entire day (or two!) to see this park. The hotel is VERY attentive, very friendly, the food is exceptional, the pool is refreshing, and everything was perfect. Remember to bring a flashlight for night since they turn the electricity off, I wish they would keep it on at night (it will be darker than you expect it to be!) so BRING A FLASHLIGHT!! TRAIGA UNA LINTERNA.  Get up early to do a sunrise tour, just make sure you know what it's going to cost you (ask at the desk the night before!) - it will cost you more to get into the park for that extra hour (park entrance fee + early morning park entrance fee) so plan to stay that whole day to make it worth it. Bring lunch, water, and snacks to the park"
30,"Visitors to Tikal have two basic options; to stay in Flores which is an hour or so away by car or to take one of the hotels in the park itself. We chose the latter option, which suited us better and all things considered we were happy enough with the Tikal Inn.  We arrived without having made a reservation (it was after all the low season) and with minimal negotiations we booked in for the night at a reasonable rate which included a set dinner and breakfast. The room by the pool was basic but adequate - a plumbing problem was quickly sorted out by a willing soul armed with plunger and rubber gloves.  As readers will have realised by now, electricity is only available at certain times, so hot showers, use of the free WiFi and battery charging does need to be pre-planned. Having"
50,"We were very very glad we stayed in the park and Tikal Inn was a great choice. The place is nice, clean, very very friendly. We went into the park with their guide who was fantastic. We arrived mid-day, took a sunset tour with him, then the kids wanted to get up for the sunrise tour the next morning (which we did). The pool was fairly cold but our kids didn't care. We had a family room which easily slept the 4 of us - a nice advantage, less expensive than getting 2 separate rooms.   Communicating with them by e-mail took awhile, but it's because their internet is not that reliable. But it worked, our reservation was there, all was as promised. The food was even good.   They arranged our colectivo transport back to the airport which was a really interesting cultural experience"
40,"The hotel is located inside the Tikal park which is a great advantage. The rooms are basic and clean but there's no amenities.  We didn't realize the electricity has a schedule (6-8 am and 6-9 pm) so we needed to plan ahead to charge cameras and cell phones. I think same applies to hot water. For off hours, there's emergency lanterns in some rooms (definitively need them for sunrise and sunset tours). The food at the restaurant was plain - nothing to rave about. You may be better off go to Flores, if willing to drive for 40 minutes back and forth.  The guided tours were the best part. The guys that lead the tours know a lot about the ruins and the culture so it's totally worth waking up at 3:30 am to take the sunrise tour (better than the sunset one, in my opinion)."
30,"I know we sometimes like the cricket and jungle sounds. This was a little too much for me. It was a nice experience due to that we were in the Tikal national park, we only had to walk to into it and the temples and pyramids were already there. The food was ok, you are better off eating 50 kms away in las Flores."
30,"We stayed at Tikal Inn on our trip through Guatemala. It was very convenient to be located inside the park and during the off-season the rates weren't too bad, but relative to the rest of Guatemala the rates were much higher. The hotel itself looks like it could use an update/renovation. Breakfast included in our rate was decent, standard pancakes, fruit and coffee. The rooms were for the most part clean, but there was a giant roach that crawled across our floor, I'm not sure there's much you can do about that when you're staying in the middle of the jungle. The hotel also offered free access to their computers and internet during the hours when power was available (6-10 pm).  The room they placed us in was right next to the front driveway and we could hear people talking"
40,"We were at the Tikal Inn on Oct 10th. (full moon) Totally awesome experience to stay adjacent to a living jungle. Power does goes off @ 10:00 ish; but that's when the fun begins.   We had no bugs and just a few Geiko's hanging around (literally lol) the screens. Our Bungalow was totally sealed. The sound of the Howler Monkeys, birds and insects was  breathtaking. Best sleep that I have ever had.  We skipped the Sunset and Sunrise tours due to us being scared of the Jungle in the dark.  I am sure it's totally fine, of course; but we were beat from that days tour and liked I said scared LOL.  The menu choices that came with our overnight pkg. was good. A little on the small side, but tasty. We had the bkft and supper included.  Touring Tikal was unbelievable. We spent 2 full days"
40,"First, I will say that if you are going to Tikal, staying in the park is a must. It’s truly a major part of the experience, and getting into the park at sunrise and sunset (one of the tour options) can’t be beat. It’s the best time to be in the park…coolest, least buggy, and you’ll get to experience all of the jungle sounds. The hotel itself is nothing spectacular, but they do a great job and everything is clean and comfortable. We got upgraded to a bungalow at no extra cost! The staff is friendly and knowledgeable, and the pool is lovely! You won’t be disappointed with Hotel Tikal Inn."
40,"Friendly, helpful, on time, where they are supposed to be.  And that's just the bus. Relaxing, laid back, good food in the restaurant.  Very clean.  Pool that I could actually swim in and enjoy. Very quiet.  Downsides.  Electricity is off at regular times each day. Bungalow no AC.  Didn't bother me but might have if it was hotter. Minor problem with water fill line for toilet.  More than made up by the wonderful staff and the owner who gave me a free ride back to Flores in the hotel bus.  The reason I needed a ride was that the tour ""van"" I was  supposed to take drove off without me because he had already filled up with ""other"" passengers that he could charge.    Take a hint.  Contact the Tikal Inn and make ALL your local arrangements through them.  They are reliable which seems"
30,"If you want to see Tikal, you must stay in the park.  I loved Tikal and the best part was the sunrise tour that you need to stay in the park to do.  This hotel was perfectly adequate but the service was bad.    The rooms were nicer than I expected but certainly not amazing.  The pool was great after a long day of hiking.  We took the morning flight in from Guates and arrived at the hotel earlier than check in.  We asked when the room would be ready and they said it would not take long.  After over 2 hours of sitting around we got annoyed and had lunch at Jaguar Inn. (not very good!)  Finally we were able to get in our room after lunch.  The other irritation was at dinner when they offered us a menu with a number of options.  We ordered and then they told us the only thing left"
50,"My wife and I spent a night at the Jungle Lodge (JL) Feb. 28, 2009.  The JL is just outside the entrance to the Tikal ruins and it’s an easy walk from the lodge right into Tikal.  You’re also a short walk away from the visitor’s center and museums as well as a comedor (think local diner) where you can get meals at a decent price.  The JL is surrounded by the jungle (as the name implies) and the grounds are well kept with beautiful plants.  The staff is friendly and helpful and does their best to ensure your stay is a pleasant one.  Our room at the JL was really spacious and set in a cabana.  It was nicely done with a tile floor, nice wooden dresser and armoire, king-sized bed (with mosquito net), a large couch, chair, stand fan, and a bathroom with a huge tub, shower (with HOT"
40,"This Lodge certainly would not suit all, if your preference is for the higher end of the market, then you should stay in Flores some 1 1/4 hrs away. However what you get here is a pleasant room with bathroom, which includes a  lovely veranda with two comfortable chairs to sit in the sun and read etc overlooking the gardens.  Yes, the generater operates in the morning & evening to heat the water and sometimes a short spell at lunch time - but certainly not all day - you must remember you are privileged to be staying in the park. The lighting is no longer switched off at night and the howler monkeys may act as your morning alarm!  What do you get - it is a 2 mins walk to the park entrance & a further a further 10 - 15 mins walk to the Grand Plaza. You can be there before anyone"
10,"Park opens at 6am. 15 minutes to get to and climb tower 2 (which provides a great vantage point for tower 1).  The morning mist swirls through the jungle, the birds are making a wonderful amount of noise, you are in another world and at 6.30 am the Jungle Lodge turns on it's diesel generator and it sounds as if there is a helicopter hovering over the park for the rest of the day."
40,"As everyone says, the location is great - the nearest of the hotels to the park, although there isn't that much in it.  The rooms are basic, the mosquito net adequate, at least this January when there were no mossies in the room.   And thank goodness the electricity does go off overnight - the generator makes a lot of noise.  But do bring a torch, you'll need it for getting back from the park at 6.00pm anyway.  The resturant food was good - the steak the best meal we had in Guatemala.  But they had only nachos and cheese when we arrived at 2.30pm for lunch, and no still bottled water the next day."
10,"I was supposed to stay at the Jungle Lodge January 12-13, 2009.  Unfortunately we had to cancel because my boyfriend hurt his back and needed back surgery.  I e-mailed the Jungle Lodge to let them know and wanted to see if I could get a refund.  They said they would refund my money if I gave them my bank account.  I felt uneasy about this so I opened a new account with my bank so they could transfer the money.  Ever since I did this, I kept e-mailing them to transfer the money and they never did.  They also refused to respond to any of my e-mails after this."
40,"My boyfriend & I stayed here for one night in January 2009 as part of a trip to Tikal -- we wanted to spend one night in the park and there are obviously very limited choices.  The hotel location is great and the rooms are large -- we stayed in one of the ""junior suites"" -- with a huge king bed, really big bathroom and outside patio.  Our room was comfortable if not glamorous and was fully screened which was great.  There is a mosquito tent over the bed but I think it's really just for show as it does not nearly cover the whole bed to be effective!  We were actually disappointed the lodge didn't shut off the power at 9 p.m. as we were originally told -- battery power kept the lights on all night and we actually were looking forward to the dark of the jungle for stargazing, etc. "
30,"We stayed here to see Tikal in a leisurely fashion - which was great.  The rooms were clean, but nothing special.  The food alternated between marginal and downright bad.  The swimming pool looks gorgeous in the photos, but was very dirty when we arrived and I saw many people arrive in their bathing suits (as I had) and decide not to swim after they saw the condition of the water.  Our travel agent told us that this was the nicest hotel in the park. Location can't be beat. and that's the best thing going for it.  There are funny signs in the lobby that say, ""Do not lie on the furniture"". At first I didn't get it, but I had a sleepless night listening to  the howler monkeys (that were literally swinging from the trees near our room.) We were bleary eyed  the next day, but how"
40,"We booked this hotel after researching it on the internet and then contacting them directly.  We were going to Tikal and the previous year had stayed in Santa Elena but it was about an hr+ drive from the park.  This year we decided to stay directly inside the park. We wanted to do the sunrise tour where you go into the park early before sunrise and climb up on top of temple VI (the highest temple) to watch the sunrise. We arrived to the hotel and it was beautiful with all the flowers and fauna.  Then again, how could it not be, being in the jungle and all.  I was definitely impressed.  I had low expectations after reading others reviews but I simply loved it.  The rooms are in cute little casitas.  The rooms themselves are not the most immaculate rooms ever, but what do you"
20,"The location couldn't be better.  The food was awful.  Just terrible.  My friends had raviolis that were uneatable.  The sauce was like a flour gravy with no taste, yuck!  I had a steak that I believe made me sick for the rest of my travels.  And the free breakfast was cold toast.  The room was ok.  If the mosquito nets aren't just for show then they are a joke.  Many holes in them.  We saw a toucan right outside our door so that was awesome.  A real shame about the restaurant.  And no electricity through the night, which was fine."
30,"Great location and adds to the wonderful experience that is Tikal. the bungalows are comfortable - huge bathroom - lousy shower but you are in the jungle after all. Dirty swimming pool! Front desk staff appeared uninformed and not really that welcoming. Head waiter/restaurant manager was very abrupt and unfriendly and kept pushing for a tip. I would not recommend eating there in the evening - they have a buffet - very little choice and ridiculously overpriced for what it is!! Having said that, if you do the 5 hour Tikal tour then lunch is included afterwards and it was delicious - no consistency here as dinner felt like a rip-off. Did not ruin our jungle experience - just a warning to fellow travellers not to do the same. Our guide for the day, Hector was just great - a real"
30,"Staying at the Tikal Inn was like stepping into a slapstick comedy.  Inspired by the reviews of Tripadvisor Members, I booked a bungalow with breakfast & dinner option for four nights and a tour to the Yaxha site with Roxy Ortiz.  The Tikal Inn generously added a free Sunrise Tour, although this did not include the early morning entrance fee of Q100 to enter the site at 4 am for the Sunrise Tour.  If one wishes to explore the Tikal site during the day, an additional Q150 is charged for the hours of 6 am to 6 pm.  Arriving two days earlier than expected, I enquired if my stay could be moved forward.  While space was indeed available, I was informed that “nothing can be done without a reservation,” and all records of my reservation had vanished.  Having been warned that"
40,"A nice and comfortable lodging facility located amid the jungles of Tikal National Park in Guatemala. We toured the Tikal Mayan ruins with Luis, a trained birding guide, provided by Cayaya Birding.  He also was very knowledgeable with the history behind the ruins."
50,"I've been meaning to write a review of Tikal Inn since staying there last August, 2010.  What a great experience!  There are 3 hotels at the Tikal ruins, right on the perimeter of the rain forest.  This is the one that my cousin and his wife, who live in Guatemala, recommended.  It is run by a brother and sister, both of whom spoke English, and who, along with their employees, were very customer oriented.  It is an environmentally focused hotel which strives to blend in with the environment and takes care to leave little impact to the local area. The thatched roof hut that we stayed in was rustic but adequate.  There is no air conditioning at the hotel, just ceiling fans and open windows. Everything was clean.   Hey - you're in the rain forest - so you need to be prepared for a"
30,"Hotel is overall in good condition. They have you by the proverbials when it comes to price though. Compared to the competition they offer a relative price however it's still expensive for what you get. Best things are the food and the pool. The bungalow is roomy with 2 double beds and a good concrete shower, however, no mosqito net is provided and the screens around all the windows and eves are holier than Jesus. The electricity only works for a few hours in the evening so be prepared to wake up sweating if you've closed the windows to keep the bugs out. The organised trips are good but pricey. The guide we had for teh park was knowledgable, spoke good english but was immensley annoying. At one point he was feeding the Pizotes which is generally discouraged. Also be aware that"
50,"The Tikal Inn is exactly what you would expect within a National Park located in a rain forest - it is rustic, but well kept and clean.  Even though there is limited electricity, it is a nice place, and has a great pool to cool off in.  Being in a rain forest, it gets hot and you should expect to sweat. This is the second time I've stayed here.  If you are looking for a luxury hotel, this is not the place, especially since there isn't air conditioning, or even fans after the electricity turns off at 10 pm.  The staff is really great though, and the individual bungalows are a great sleep option.  I would stay definitely stay here again.  The best part of the stay in Tikal though was our guide, Ronnie.  He works in the Tikal Inn as a certified Tikal tour guide.  He was extremely"
30,We picked Jungle Lodge because we wanted to stay in the park itself and it was the best that was available. That said... don't expect much. The accommodation was decent but nothing great. Clean enough and nice enough. We lost power several times but that is just a fact of life in Guatemala. The breakfast was great although with limited choices - but don't be afraid to ask for something different that is not on the menu and you just may get it. Dinner... show up sooner than later as the choices go down as the time progresses.  The pool was dirty and over chlorinated.  The best thing about Jungle Lodge was that you are right in the middle of the park and it is great to get up early to see the sunrise and then come back for breakfast and see the sunset in the evening.  Flores is
30,"We stayed two nights in their room that sleeps 5. It was great staying inside the park, you get to enjoy what's around when other people leave.  The rooms are basic, but nice having private bathroom. The rooms were also very clean. Only complaint was the beds were a little too uncomfortable, even our teenagers had trouble with the beds. The food was also good in their resturant. And we also like that they did have access to the internet during the hours that they had electricity, there is a smal fee to use it."
40,"I just returned last night from 11 days in Guatemala, including 2 nights at the Jungle Lodge. Two years ago, we stayed at the Tikal Inn, so i feel prepared to compare the 2 best properties (and most expensive) in Tikal. Overall, the Jungle lodge is the better experience. The Tikal Inn has the cleaner, more pristine pool, but the rooms are nicer, the staff more professional, the guides excellent and the amenities including the bar and internet access are better at the Jungle. Booze is not cheap, so buy bottles in Flores and bring with. Rates on the back of the door stated $100 US per person for double occupancy for a private room. Rooms had mosquito nets and fans and we had no probs with mosquitoes while sleeping. Dorm style rooms may be available. Meal selection and selection"
50,"My wife and I stayed at the Jungle Lodge inside the park. The food was good and the beers were cold. It was really great to be inside the park. I like hearing all of the animal noises at night.  We booked ahead of time. Had to send several emails before we got a response. Other than that, it wasn't a problem. Just finished putting up my video from the trip.   http://ourdistantjourney.com/northamerica/tikal-guatemala.   You can see the flight, the drive to the area and shots from inside the park (including a toucan and monkeys). We were by ourselves in the late afternoon. I would highly recommend Tikal.   Cheers, Darren"
50,"This hotel was a little more expensive that what we want to spend, but ended up being really excellent.   True 4 star standard, with big and clean room that had a mozzie net.  So it was great not just for a place in a middle of a jungle, but it was just a great hotel (well bungalows I guess).  Dinner wasn't that nice though, but then again we only eat there once, so who cares."
40,"Tikal inn is not amazingly luxurious, though the little thatched cottages are nicer than the other rooms. But staying overnight here is a no brainer. Its basically utterly amazing to see tikal at sunrise. You have to do it. And Rony, the Hotel Tikal inn guide is young and knowledgeable and will show you what you need to, both i. Terms of the temples, but also the wildlife... Toucans, boa constrictors, etc.  The food is much much better than you would expect. Very tasty, though not cordon bleu."
40,"My husband and I stayed here for one night in July.  We obtained a special rate of $100 per night which included a bungalow, breakfast, dinner and the sunrise tour for two.   I thought it was a good value.  The room and food were adequate for us and we really enjoyed the sunrise tour.  We paid an extra 100Q as we entered the park in the morning.  Since we stayed from about 4:30 am to 9:30 am, it was enough time for me.  If you want to return, you need to pay the entrance fee again.   The rate was $10 per person to take the hotel shuttle to the airport.  We had no problems going by shuttle from Coban to Flores or while we were in the Peten area."
50,"I must say I read some of the reviews and did not know what to expect..it is not for your everyday tourist. If you are in eco-tourism, you'll get more than you bargain. the place is in the middle of the sub-tropical jungle, and it's the best place to see the magical Tikal Ruins in both sunrise and sunset.  the hotel was very accomodating, we got there very early and although check-in was in the pm, they were very accomodating providing my wife and I, a room to rest until ours was ready.  We did not see any bugs as per one review I read, but here is a hint:  ""you are in the jungle!"".  The pool was very nice and the bungalow was more than expected.  mind you, you'll have screens instead of windows so shhh.  it is a very serene atmosphere, and takes you away from some of the"
40,"We traveld to Tikal on our own from San Ignacio. We chose the Tikal Inn since it had a pool.  We used it a lot since there is no air conditioning in the room. Electricity is not on all day but it was not an issue. Bring your own toiletries, they only provied a bar of soap and towels in the room.  This is the nicest hotel in the park.  I would highly recommend staying in the park to get the full experience.  Pros:  Short walk to the ruins, nice pool, great service, clean, friendly and helpful staff, access to guided tours when you get there.  Cons: No air conditioning, no pool hours ( our cabana faced the pool and there were swimmers from another hotel who came in to swim.  They were VERY loud and rude!), food was fair."
50,"Many people make the trek to Tikal for the day - and it is quite a trek for those who are visiting Belize as I was.  I saw that the Tikal Inn had sunset and sunrise tours of the ruins and so I decided to stay overnight at the Tikal Inn - which is inside the National Park.  This was the most amazing experience.  The hotel was clean and beautiful.  The cabanas surrounded the pool, which was clean and refreshing.  A toucan flew over the pool while I was swimming.  The food was included with the room and was really delicious.  The tour guide (Ronny) was the best and gave us both the sunset and sunrise tours.  He chose beautiful places for us to take pictures, and there was no one else in the National Park while we were there, because it was closed to the general public.  Besides"
40,"We spent two nights at the Jungle Lodge.  The location is perfect for sunset or sunrise trips into the Tikal park, since the lodge is a two-minute walk to the park gate.  However, the food in the restaurant is not very good.  Be prepared for poor food and enjoy the location.  We stayed in the best room they had, which was the Junior Suite.  It was modern, clean, and very nice.  In fact, they made a mostly-successful attempt to make it classy, including a huge tub and separate shower.  I recommend that type of room.  I did not see what the other rooms were like.  As a possible alternative, you might want to consider something like Hotel El Muelle, which is about a half hour drive away in the town of El Remate.  We stopped there as we were leaving Tikal and swam in the lake in"
40,"The location of this hotel is just perfect. It sits right on the entrance to the amazing park of Tikal. We were able to do both a night trip to Tikal during a full moon night and the usual sunrise trip everyone takes without getting up too early and taking any bus early in the morning.  The room was clean and comfortable and the shower was good but the hours of the hot water are very limited. Other than that, the room is very limitedly equipped and quite expensive. There is a restaurant in the hotel perimeter which is also a bit expensive. Dinner was okay, breakfast is okay. Also, note that the breakfast is served till late (about eleven) and not as stated in the signs of the hotel (till nine).  Internet service is available but is also a bit expensive. All in all it is a good"
40,"I just got back from a stay of two nights at the Jungle Lodge.  There is no better location to stay in Tikal if you want to be close to the ruins and sleep in the middle of the jungle.  The Jungle Lodge is right next to the park entrance, a 10 minute walk to the Grand Plaza of Tikal.  You will thank the great location if you do the sunrise tour of Tikal (an absolute must).  The tour usually starts at 445am, that means that if you are coming from a hotel in Flores (45 minute drive to Tikal) you have to get up sometime between 3am and 330am.  Staying at the Jungle Lodge gets you an extra hour of sleep.  The hotel was much better than I expected.  Good friendly service, nice restaurant and bar and a very nice swimming pool.  I stayed in one of the bungalows.  The room was ok, clean"
40,"Stayed at the Jungle Lodge During Spring Break. It was nice except the power would go out at 9 pm or 10 pm, the bugs and we had to move because our bathroom flooded. I liked the food and the proximity to Tikal National Park."
40,"well I guess you can't complain too much about the location! right next to the park entrance, but also right in the middle of the jungle! when describing the hotel itself, it wouldn't be a hotel I would pay $50 for in Flores or another city in Guatemala, but wow.... I really did enjoy the pool.  after walking around the park for a whole or part day, it felt pretty good swimming in a nice pool with huge trees all around. the room that I stayed in was clean, but basic. the restaurant was nice, but service wasn't great. but what the heck.... I would deffinitly go back if I was to go back to Tikal!"
50,"I came to Tikal for a 2 day/1 day overnight from Antigua and stayed at the Tikal Inn. I was solo, and the staff welcomed me with open arms. They picked me up at the airport in a comfortable AC van. Alex and the staff were friendly, helpful and outgoing. The food was abundant and really good. A little pricey, in Guatemalan terms, but delicious. The pool and lounge chairs were perfect after a hot sunset tour and after the sunrise tour, while waiting for the shuttle back to the airport. The room was spacious, clean and actually quite cool (it rained at night, which cooled everything down) because of the cross breeze. There isn't cell service, but there is Wifi...so if you need reception, plan accordingly.  The only downside was my tour guide, Nixon. He was unable to answer very"
40,"I suppose it depends on what your expectations are but I was pretty much delighted with my trip to Tikal. The food is not the best and if you want to rest in your room during the day you can't because it is unbearably hot - there is limited electricity - just twice a day a couple of hours in the morning and between 6 and 10 at night so this means that air con just isn't going to happen. But, personally I would rather have my screened windows and be able to hear the jungle outside. Be woken up to the sound of the howler monkeys that sound like someone snoring loudly in the next bungalow.   The room was basic but very clean, the bed incredibly comfortable and there was hot water. What else can you want. I guess if you want air con, cable TV and all mod cons the Tikal Inn isn't for"
50,"only reason to stay in tikal is for the sunrise tours. if you are considering sunrise or sunset tours, please do seek out roxy ortiz. tikal_roxy@yahoo.com. by far the best guided tour i've ever had. given she's an archeologist her knowledge of the area is extensive, making for a far better tour.  don't bother booking a tour with anyone else if possible.  (We hung out with her for the day and had a great time. She even cabbed my cell phone back to san ignacio after i forgot it)"
20,"This is a very beautiful place. Nice gardens, surrounded by all that wild nature. The service was average. I had read other reviews and expected better food and service. The staff needs to care more for their appearance. It was weird all over the place. At the recpetion you are greeted by a huge young man with an emo look. Hair covering his face. Weird stuff. You don´t know if you are visiting a nice hotel, or some kind of  teenage mental hispoital. The guide, oh my my God! We didn´t knew if we were going to be guided into the area o kidnapped. I had the chance to see two male guides, and both had careless looks too. Either they were depressed or simply care less about how they look and how guests might feel about that. The tour was equally proportional to his looks. We were"
40,The hotel was very modest but well kept.  Naturally as you are in the jungle you will have issues with mosquitoes and bugs but the hotel itself was clean.  It was hot but that is expected in May and with the power unable to be on there is no fans.  If you need air conditioning I wouldn't recommend staying here.    The staff was very helpful especially Ricardo and his son who spoke English well.  We did the Sunrise tour and it was amazing though sweltering hot and humid in the AM.  I've heard the sunset is a better view of the ruins on the 4th temple due to the haze in the AM.    I would definitely stay again if I was doing the tour because your other options of staying near Tikal and then coming just adds time to your Tikal experience and really you could spend all day there.
10,"Our first (and last) visit to the Jungle Loge in Tikal was a disaster.  When we arrived, they would not take our luggage to our room.  We had to carry it ourselves.  The first room they gave us the door lock was broken (when we stuck the key in the lock it just spun around) and when we asked for a different room the lady (Miriam) at the front desk got upset like we were inconveniencing her.  Also note that this is not tourist season and there was hardly anyone in the hotel.  there were lots of extra rooms.  Then each night we went to the hotel restaurant they did not have any food.  One night when the power was out, we along with some others went to eat and the cooks were mad that they had to work and they told us the only had one item on the menue and we could take it or leave"
40,"We stayed here for two nights because of its proximity to the National Park and the pool.  On both counts it was a good choice.  We were pleasantly surprised that the electricity was on all night!  Our ceiling fan got pretty noisy after it was on for several hours, but that could easily be adjusted, I'd think.  We were surprised that the hotel did not have filtered water available to the guests, however.  We stayed at much cheaper places on our Guatemala trip that all had a water dispenser.    All in all, it was a nice place to stay.  The hotel clerk made arrangements for a Canopy Tour ziplining the next day, at any time that we wanted, for $30/person.  The guy from Canopy Tours was right on time and we had a blast.  Finally, we paid $102/night which included breakfast--not sure"
30,"Stayed one night (just last night) at the Jungle Lodge on a quick trip to Tikal. The location is unbeatable. The rest of the experience was underwhelming.   I am typing this review from the pricey internet cafe in the lobby - 6 USD per hour. BE sure to have exact change, or you will have to wait around for them to find you change.   When I made the reservation, I was assured by the receptionist that we would not have to pay park entrance admission to get to the hotel. When we arrived at the ticket booth yesterday, just outside of the hotel entrance, we were told by the park administration that we had to pay, and were not permitted to enter until we had paid (Q150), despite the fact that we had no intention of visiting the ruins until today.They insisted that as long as you are"
50,"Perfect spot in Tikal park. Way more than we expected.  Good food, cold beer. helpful employees.  They nights without generators were hot, but they left lanterns on the porch in case you needed light at night.  Great pool.  Make sure to walk into the park at sunset and climb a temple.  Then walk out in the dusk with a flashlight.  The best experience.  Nice little bungalows with huge bathrooms and showers. Monkeys howeling at night.  They even have internet while the genorators are running."
30,"The only reason to stay here is because you want to be in the Tikal National Park.  And for what you pay, it's not a bad place to go, but you wil remind yourself you are there for the park not for the accommodations, food or service.  Each room is part of a duplex.  Ours was roomy enough (never a real big deal to me either way), and though sorely overdue for a remodel (or at least new bedding), it was clean and relatively comfortable- we slept well.  There is no TV (you're there for the park) and the power does go out at 11PM (you're there for the park) and the tropical location means you do have certain parts of the great outdoors coming to stay with you (insects)- you're there for the park.  Everyone we met in Guatemala is perfectly nice, but the staff at the Jungle Lodge were"
10,"We paid for a stay in this property before we were informed about the change in ticketing policy.  This place was a complete misery.  First, it was extremely hot and our private bungalow was scorching.  With no fans and no air conditioning, there was nowhere to escape the heat.  As others mentioned, the electricity is only on from 6pm-10pm.  Not having lights is not a big issue, but there's no fans either.  This is horrible because you are indoors and don't even have electricity to turn on the fan.  After 10pm they cut off the electricity (and room fan) it's not exactly cold either, so it was the worst night's sleep I ever had.  Another couple we met had paid for 2 days of park (but at $20+ per day per person, the costs add up).  They seemed to be bored on the 3rd day since"
40,"Located about 90 minutes outside of Flores, Peten, the Hotel Tikal Inn is set in the midst of Guatemala's Tikal National Park and offers the ideal location for exploring this historical site.  The hotel's accomodations are comfortable, offering spacious casitas with large beds and private baths.  While the decor was a bit dated, the furnishings and linens were of decent quality.  Relying on private generators for electricity, power at the Hotel Tikal Inn is only available in the mornings and evenings.  While other park hotels provide power all day long, you'll likely be spending your days exploring the temples anyway.  Still, some may have difficulty sleeping without air conditioning or ceiling fans during Guatemala's warmer months.    Located about 30 minutes by foot from the"
50,"The Tikal Inn was an absolute highlight of our trip.  From the very comfortable rooms, private bathrooms, amazing food in the restaurant, friendly service, beautifully appointed tropical gardens, and large swimming pool, the Tikal Inn was simply the best.  My husband and I are nature lovers on a budget.    When we decided to visit Tikal, we were origionally planning on staying in Flores due to its reputation for being more economical.  After doing a little research, it was clear that as ""backpackers"" we could stay at the Tikal Inn, within the Tikal National Park for approximately the same price.  In addition, we figured out that in order to do a true Sunrise Tour, we needed to spend the night in the park and not in Flores.  Tours leaving from Flores aren't allowed into the park"
50,"Definitely stay here when visiting Tikal National Park. No tv, no radios, no telephones in the rooms, but more reason, time to spend wandering the ruins of Tikal.  Power/lights go off at about 10 p.m. so you have ample opportunity to sleep, listening to the sounds of the jungle.   A short walk to park entrance as compared to an hour+ drive if you stay in Flores.  Guided tours in/to the park and temples at sunset and sunrise when any crowds are gone is incredible.  The sunrise tour, sitting on the top of a temple as the jungle wakes up was worth getting up well before sunrise.  Ricardo, the manager, was an incredible help to us.  Cancelled airline flights/late arrival at the hotel made for a poor start to our visit, but he spent the time on the phone while we visited the park to"
30,"We were in room 7 and smelled sewer odors for our entire stay...inside and directly outside our room.  It was disgusting.  Also, several of the people in rooms near us were woken up by a guide at 3am....it was very loud for the next hour while people got ready for their excursion.  There are no windows....just screens so you can't close out the noise.    The staff was very friendly and the pool was quite enjoyable.  The food was ok and the drinks were expensive especially given the tiny amount of alcohol they put in them.  The location was perfect and we were able to enjoy Tikal multiple times during our 1 night stay.  Everything besides the sewer odor was acceptable.  I am told that the pipes come up directly behind our room, so maybe you just want to avoid room 7........."
50,"We stayed here on an overnighter from Belize. Our package included dinner and breakfast.  Our room was bright, cheery and spacious. We had a few visitors though which made the stay a little more exciting! The first was a scorpion, then we had a tarantula! The howler monkeys were loud to say the least, but its all part of the package!  I think some people tend to forget where they are when they stay in a hotel and expect the world. This is a small place in the middle of a national park in Guatamala. Not some resort in Cancun.   I thought this place was charming, and would definitely go back if i were to go to Guatamala again."
30,"We stayed at the Jungle Lodge, Tikal at the end of March for 2 nights, having booked the full package with Belize.explorer.com. We were staying for 2 weeks in Mexico and wanted to visit tikal as we have previously visited Chichen Itza and Coba. We loved the location of the Lodge and found Tikal to be amazing, the Mayan site as well as the wildlife. Our room was large, ensuite (huge bathroom) and very clean and the ceiling fan was great when the electricity was on. We knew the electricity would be off at times and this was not a problem- we have stayed in costa Rica with no electicity or hot water, so it was fine.  We only had a few minor issues with the hotel. One was that they provided no shampoo, but sold it in the gift shop which was a bit annoying for what is a relatively"
30,"I have just spent one night at the Jungle Lodge as part of a Tikal /Livingstone package and found it to be ok. The double room was basic but  clean. It was not ensuite but there were good clean shower and wc blocks nearby, and towels provided. The electricity goes off overnight but  oil lamps are provided (might be an idea to pack a torch!) The staff were ok, there is a small pool to cool down in and you are right next to the Jungle. I had no complaints."
30,"Jungle Lodge was fun!  One morning we greeted our neighbour  who turned out to be a DJ from Michigan and we all went into this familiar riff and rant about the world economy and how the American sub-prime market had sent houses prices spiralling downwards, we talked about the war, and leaving the US and the UK for good.  And all the while howler monkeys and parrots in the trees above maintained their own cacophonous conversations about how mass tourism is wrecking the Peten . . .    Our tour operator - Journey Latin America - had booked us into Jungle Lodge with a warning about the food and the service.  In fact, the food was OK, given that you don’t expect or indeed want foie gras or lobster.  They did a chewy but tasty steak, with decent fries, washed down with Chilean pinot"
40,"There is nothing wrong with the accommodation at Jungle Lodge. The towels are luxurious, the bathrooms nice and the rooms are clean and comfortable. Check in is quick and friendly, and they speak exceptionally good english. But - with the power shutting off at 10pm the rooms are dark and hot. There is very little insulation between the room on the other side of the cabana so you can hear conversations, coughing, doors opening and closing. Then, when you finally fall asleep the howler monkeys start with their incredible noises and it's a night without much sleep.  BUT - Tikal at sunset and at a sunrise really is the best part. It's quiet and the wild life is abundant (we saw at least 25 monkeys!), and it's magical. And staying at the jungle lodge is the best option in the area."
50,"The location was fabulous, the staff was very nice, and Ricardo was very helpful sorting out tours and a mixup with the lunch vouchers.  We were even given a regular room to take a nap in while waiting for our bungalow to be ready.  power was spotty and DEFINATELY have a flashlight handy for after the electricity goes off for the night, but we were perfectly comfortable even though we went during the hottest season of the year.  It was a little expensive for Guatemala, but the location and pool were worth it.  Heartily recommend."
50,"After a night at the Jaguar Inn next door, we moved to this gem of a hotel. Not only did it include free use of the swimming pool and internet for less money, the staff were fantastic, friendly and the rooms comfortable and spotlessly clean. Ricardo and his son Irwin run a tight ship.  We were attracted by the hotel's $25 sunset AND sunrise tours (3hrs each) - both of which were unmissable, and are our best English guided tour in Guatemala. Thanks to Hiro and Ronny, we now feel like experts in the life of Tikal.   Don't be put off by the listed price here. Rooms start from US$40 with private bathroom. This is the best deal in the region and much better value than a package tour from Flores."
50,We came here not knowing what to expect and where totally surprised it was great it's not a 5 star hotel like a Sheraton but it's 5 star in the park the food was good the staff where super helpful and friendly in the heat of the day the pool invigorating after our dusk and dawn tours of the Tikal ruins - Ronny you are an amazing guide your passion of the Mayan civilization and wildlife really taught and made an impact on us all  including your sense of humor  thankyou all at the Tikal inn for making our stay a life experience
40,The hotel is very well located and calm. The food is very good. The pool and deckchairs are clean.The furniture in my room was very basic but the bed was comfortable and the room and bathroom were very clean. I was not informed about the lack of electricity at certain hours so I did not take a flashlight with me. I was a bit scared when I woke up at night and could not find my way to the bathroom. So take a flashlight with you!  Jolanta from Canada
40,"We spent 3 nights in this hotel and were very satisfied with our stay. The manager of the hotel is great! Very helpful and very friendly!  We could change some money at the front desk which was good. Beware that between certain times there is no electricity, so ask at the desk when the power is shut down and make sure you bring torches with you! However this is not a problem because, if I remember correctly, the power is down during the day when you don’t really need it anyway. We didn't suffer from it in any case. The rooms are roomy and comfortable. The beds are clean and comfy.  The hotel has a swimming pool and a restaurant. The key to this hotel is that it is ideally located at the entrance of the Tikal Park.  Through the hotel we had a guide for the evening we arrived to"
50,"We stayed 2 nights and it was much better than we expected.  Spacious cabanas spread round the grounds, roomy inside.  The best thing was the wildlife all around - howler monkeys kicking up a racket and lots of birds; the pool seemed well - maintained.  Restaurant very pleasant and food quite good.  Right by the entrance to the site.Overall Jungle Lodge is good value for money at US$102 inc breakfast for a double and $77 single.  Only problem we had was booking - its an office somewhere else and they seemed rather sleepy - I had to ring a couple of times to confirm the booking.  In the morning (8am) we had a guide Carlos who was very good and knowledgeable.  Tixal itself is pretty amazing, especially the Plaza Major. Unless you want to see the sunrise you don't neeed to start at"
30,"This is probably the best hotel directly located at the Tikal Archeological Park. Do not expect luxury and book in advance, as the prices you pay when you book the hotel at the airport are too high. The location is perfect but the value is bad compared to other places in Guatemala."
40,This was the best of the 3 hotels near Tikal for rooms and food.  It is pleasant staying next to the temples so you can view and wander at your leisure.  Ask for Vinicio as your guide.  He spoke perfect English and was incredibly knowledgeable about Mayan history.  (He is a second generation guide).   Also sign up for the morning tour.  It’s pretty cool hearing the sounds of the jungle wake up from top of a Mayan temple.  It was too foggy for us so we didn’t get to see the sunrise over the temples but the additional tour time still made the price worthwhile.
50,"My husband and I took our children 7 and 12. We loved it. Its very clean, good service and great food. It is in the jungle. It was such an awesome experience!  I am not a rustic/roughing it kind of a person. And this was a perfect balance. Back to nature but very comfortable.  Its a short walk to the park. It was great! We didnt want to leave. Its so peaceful. I highly recommend it."
50,"The Jungle Lodge staff were very friendly and helpful (one other reviewer seems to have had a bad experience, but I would say that must have been an anomaly.)  You must be prepared for a remote location with limited infrastructure.  That said, the room was clean, comfortable and spacious. Shower/bathroom was good as well. The location - in the heart of the jungle, at the footsteps of the entrance to the National Park can't be beat.  The limited hours for electricity did not affect us.  The meals were fine/good (again, consider your location.) My wife is vegetarian and she was accommodated for in the restaurant.  We stayed in Tikal for 2 days. Would have liked 1 extra day to get plenty of hiking in and time for the zip line or rope bridge tours.  We went in August, expecting the"
50,"I can´t speak highly enough about this hotel and its staff. The service is impeccable. My  boyfriend got sick from one of the comedores down the street, and the staff has been nothing but helpful and supportive. They offered him tea and were extremely generous with their friendly service to us. Besides helping us when he got sick, the staff has been great overall. First off, the staff speaks perfect English and is willing to help you with your Spanish if you choose to practice it. Second, the tour was absolutely amazing. Tikal Inn has the best tour guides (and, I am speaking from experience, because I was in Tikal over the summer and the guide that I had then was not nearly as informative as the this one). Third, they are willing to bend over backwards to help you plan your trip"
50,"Were here for a photo documentation from Tikal ruins and faced some organisational problems with the park administration . The owner / hotel manager Richard Ortiz realised our trouble and did not only invite us to stay an additional night freeof charge  in his nice hotel , he also helped us in a great way to overcome our problem to make our stay a great expirience and photo success. The negative comments in this forum about the hotel management we cannot understand at all and we just can reccommend to choose this place for a great visit to Tikal ."
40,"Hotel Tikal Inn is not luxurious, but it is clean and friendly. The food is simple but good. The service was excellent; again very accommodating. The electricity is on only a few hours a day in the rooms, however the front desk allowed us to recharge our camera batteries there. Hey, this is in the jungles of Guatemala! The pool is lovely. The best part for us was the coati group that hung around the back. They were fun to watch. The key to enjoying Tikal Park is going for sunset and sunrise tours there with an experienced ( and for us, English speaking )guide. Pros: The park is pretty empty and the temples and plazas are amazing as the sun sets and rises. Loved the sounds of the howler monkeys at daybreak, and the birds. (Spotted a Toucan!).

50,"My husband and I were really struggling with the idea of doing a day tour from Belize,  staying in Flores or staying overnight at the park, we were so happy we stayed overnight at the TIkal Inn!!!  It made the visit to TIkal even more special.  When we arrived in the afternoon, we had lunch at the Jaguar Inn and after 3pm we entered the park and went on one of the most beautiful and interesting hike of our lives. After 3pm, the ticket is good for the next day. Tikal was so mystical and enchanting and since we were mostly alone during our hike it made it even more special, this is the benefit of staying overnight in the park, you feel like you have the place to yourselves. It was so lush and green, monkeys were everywhere, beautiful colorful birds, we even saw deer and fawn. When"
40,"My husband and I stayed at The Tikal Inn for two main reasons: to take a tour with the highly recommended Roxy, and to use a pool at midday. Well, even though the management  assured me that Roxy was available, she wasn't. In addition, it rained the entire time we were at Tikal, so there was no use for a pool. Nevertheless, this hotel proved a good choice for us. Ronny, our tour guide, was excellent- informed and enthusiastic; I would highly recommend him.  The staff was friendly and helpful, internet was free, our cabin was cozy, and the food was yummy. We would definitely return. My only beef was the initial dishonesty by the management."
40,"We traveled with my son and his family. We found the rooms to be large and clean. The young man at the desk was very kind and when my computer needed charging he did it his desk and watched over it for me. The dinner was good and they gave us extras such as dessert and juice because of the delays. We also had breakfast there and again we where treated very well. The children enjoyed ""living in the jungle"" for one day. We missed the internet but being in the jungle we could do without it."
40,"The best way to see Tikal is to stay there... this is the only way to enjoy the park without the crowds. Jungle Lodge costs more than the other places up there, but was a great place to stay. Super simple accommodations, but clean and very convenient. Plus, they have a decent restaurant.  Be sure to book your transfers to/from Flores airport with the hotel before you get there."
20,"The rooms and the grounds are very nice and the location is the best, but, the service is absolutly the worst.  The restaurant is the worst I have ever eaten at and the staff members are rude and unfriendly.  It seems that the chef thinks he is working at some fancy resort so he creates food that trys to be elegant, but misses the mark considerably.  It is not possible to get a simple sandwich or a light meal.  There is a menu, but they will not let you use it, as most of the items are not being served.  The food was so below average and the wait was unberable.  They also have no idea how to make a mixed drink, we had to instruct them, show them them which one to use, and we speak the same language they do.  It took at least an hour to be served, from time of order and then at"
40,"I have noted that there have been some unkind words written about the Jungle Lodge. I have stayed there on three occasions during the last year and given the remote location and the horrendously difficult infrastructure of the area, I have to say they do a good job. The food is a bit lackluster but they try hard, the rooms are comfortable without being luxurious, but then they are not expensive. The suites are excellent. The staff are delightful, friendly and helpful. I watched in embarrassment as an elderly guest berated a waitress for overcharging $4.00 due to a misunderstanding. The woman spoke execrable Spanish and had failed to understand the price structure. She also had no clue as to the archaic but very thorough book keeping principals of a country (justifiably) paranoid"
50,"Duplooy's in Belize arranged a stay here for us... We were impressed!  At the last minute, we decided to go to Guatemala and were glad we did.  We stayed overnight here and like others said, it was hot at night and there was no electricity.  You hear the howler monkeys and the sounds of the jungle.  It is pitch black dark without ambient light from cities or nearby homes.   But you will leave knowing what the jungle is about and getting to see one of the best mayan ruins."
40,"We loved this hotel - the rooms were very comfortable and clean and as we came preparing with torches, the electricity being turned off between 22h00 and 06h00 didn't worry us.  The food was good and the staff very helpful.    When we arrived the owner suggested we get our entry tickets and go straight up to the ruins to see the sunset - which we did; although a bit of a rush it was worth it because there was hardly anyone there.  Luckily we had the torches with us to get back though as there were no lights to light your way back along the pathways from the top of the ruins to the hotel.  We could find no obvious bad points about the hotel - only good points.  We had two downstair rooms and one upstairs room in the large bungalow at the end of the swimming pool - and these we"
40,"We stayed here for two days and one night during our visit to Tikal and enjoyed the hotel very much.  The pool and the grounds are beautiful and relaxing and we had a poolside bungalow.  This was a great way to pass some of the hotter midday hours between our tours of the ruins.  The hotel staff was very helpful and professional - the desk staff spoke English very well, though the restaurant staff not quite as well.  We found the food at the restaurant to be quite good, especially the fried fish that we had at lunch the first day.  The room and bathroom were very basic but comfortable.  The rooms only have electricity during the morning and evening hours, so that is the only time hot water is available as well.  The hotel offered internet service at two computers in the lobby"
40,"There are only three hotels in the Park area, and if you want to spend as much time as possible in the Mayan ruins, this is a nice place to do it.  We stayed for two nights.  You can walk to the entrance area for the ruins in 3 minutes, which is also where the only place to buy water and gifts/souvenirs is located.  We stayed in a junior suite - which is away from the pool.  The suite is just a large room with a two or three beds, and a bathroom.  Very spartan, but we weren't expecting a luxury resort.  The pool is very nice, and the staff extremely helpful.  We used the hotel for both morning and sunrise tours, and we loved our guides.  We had dinner at the Tikal Inn twice, and thought the food was very good, as well as good value.  Besides the other two hotels (there are all"
20,"The hotel itself is beautiful, however the service is terrible. At front desk no english speakers whatsoever. Made it so difficult to be understood with simple requests. If they charge in dollars you expect to have english speaking staff. At night a drunk lady started screaming at the back of our cabana. She got so drunk that she even climbed in a small construction at the back of the hotel and then couldn't get down. Hearing this woman screaming asking for help was a terrible experience. We could see the gardeners trying to be of help but if at front desk they don't speak english, its worse with the gardeners. We repeatedly asked to have the manager come and help but had no response. He never showed up. It seems as if this place runs by itself with the good will of the"
50,"Outstanding experience led by the hotel owner and his son. Together they take great pride in not just the hotel, but the enjoyment of their guests. We were fortunate that a transfer was organised at late notice as well as tour guides and other nearby activities. It felt very much like we were welcomed in their home as opposed to their hotel. To get the most out of Tikal, I can't imagine a better choice than staying at Hotel Tikal Inn and getting up early for the sunrise tour. If you stay in Flores, you will miss the sunrise and have to suffer crowds of tourists. I can't wait to go back to Tikal and stay here again."
40,"We stayed one night at the Jungle lodge and toured tikal the day before and until 2pm the next day.   I thought the food was really good. the service was exellent.  the rooms were nice and clean.  the beds were really comfortable.  My only complaint was the shower was barely a trickle.  the short hours of electricity were not a problem.  However in a hotter season this might have been a problem.   the proximity to the park is a huge plus.  And you cant beat the howler monkey""s wake up call for setting the mood for a really exotic experience..   We really enjoyed sitting on the porrch in the evening and watching the spider monkeys makeing  thier way to thier night roosts.  I would definately go back and stay for more time if  i didin't have a lot of places left to experince and"
40,"If you come here realizing that the rooms are very basic, you will do fine. There is no A/C, just a ceiling fan. The electricity is turned off (in all of Tikal) starting at 10:30pm and turning back on around 5:30am, but turning off again around 9am and back on at 12-2, and then back on again at 5pm. The rooms have mosquito netting but they do have some holes so not sure of their effectiveness. Also, you might have some visitors too, namely geckos but there are bigger holes in the walls that might attract a bigger variety. Oh and if you bring/use a hair dryer, turn off most lights in the room especially the ceiling fan before using it or else you will knock out power in your 2-unit complex; your neighbor might not appreciate that.   The restaurant on-site had decent food and they"
50,"The cacophony of the jungle does not begin at Temple IV for its famous sunrise symphany ... or in the canopy over your comfortable room at the Jungle Lodge; it starts with hyperactive guides from Flores and their van loads who they expletetive delelitive up to the ticket office at 4:30 AM. The horror of it all. My first animal action is not the howler monkey. Alas the trials of ""the day visitor"" who may be best intentioned but alas ... suffer the fools. I sifted through TripAvisor forums and contacted Francisco Florian at << [--] >> ... Francisco comes with the correct prerequisites for a good guide; field experience, a library, up to date site knowledge...  and he listens to the visitor ... then he guides. My 3 day package includes a very presentable guide who gave an excellent"
40,"Stayed here one night (should be sufficient for most), and thought it was great. The important thing for you, is to know what you´re getting into! Be prepared for what it is, and it might be magnificent!  Why should you stay in the park, and not in Flores? I highly recommend spending a night in the park. It is easier to do the sunrise tour (recommended), and you get to relax and enjoy the area more. The park itself includes so much walking, climbing, many bugs, heat and humidity, that it is best to do it in two, three (or even four) shorter trips (2 - 5 hours each). Of course, you can visit twice from Flores, but the pool and your own shower is much more tempting than a hot and cramped 45 minute minibus ride. Lying in or by the pool with a cold one to the sound of the howler"
30,"My Fiancé and I stayed at The Jungle Lodge for 3 days / 2 nights in April 2007.  We were staying in Mexico for 2 weeks, and arranged this mini break within the fortnight flying from Cancun to Flores.  The flight was about 1 ½ hours each way.    The Hotel / Lodge staff and facilities: The main reception, shop and bar/restaurant area were located in one building.  Reception was friendly, and explained all we needed to know.  They run night tours/walks that you can book yourself onto (we didn’t do this) and you can book the sunrise tour. The staff will explain to you that between (about) 10pm and 6am there is NO ELECTRICITY.  At about 4am you will find a lantern outside your door so that you can get ready for the sunrise tour!   There is a swimming pool on site, situated up several"
30,"We selected the Tikal Inn primarily for it's vacation and stayed in one of the bungalows around the pool.  Like all other accommodation in the park electricity is limited to 6.00-8.00 am and 6.00-10.00 pm so bring a good torch/flashlight.  Pros:  - Pleasant room, if somewhat basic room - this is not 4 star!  -  Helpful staff in the dining area  Great spiced honey to go with the breakfast pancakes.  - Ideal location for visiting the Tikal site. -  Pleasant grounds with birds and other wildlife. -  Free transportation to and from Flores airport and hotels.    Cons: - Being woken early both mornings by the kitchen staff starting work - but this was only because we were in the bungalow nearest the main hotel block which I would recommend avoiding.  - Average food in the restaurant,"
30,"We enjoyed our stay at Tikal Inn very much. We read some reviews and were not expecting much. The location is excellent. This way you can get to the ruines very early (4.30 am), get back to the hotel around 9 am, have a rest and go back after 2 pm. It is even better if you arrive around lunchtime on day 1, go to the ruines in the afternoon. Do the sunrise tour the next morning and move on.  This way you are able to visit the ruines before and after all the groups arrive. Our second night we woke up at 4 am because of a group that was going to do the sunrise tour. That is way I say great if your are doing the sunrise tour as well, but don't stay there much longer as you will be woken up by other guests.  The nights are very special here. Very, very dark (electricity shuts down"
40,"As someone already mentioned this is a great hotel to stay at while visiting Tikal and probably the only reason to stay at the hotel.  Having read some of the reviews below i'm glad i never bumped into Michael and we stayed in early January. The hotel itself is decent, clean with spacious rooms. Staff are polite and efficient. One negative about the rooms is that our one needed minor cosmetic upgrading but overall not too bad considering you are staying in the middle of the jungle.  And the location is one attribute that makes this place stand out. You are literally on the doorstep of the national park, within a few minutes walk of the main attractions. Also one other thing that makes it stand out is the food. A bit on the pricey side but really well cooked and tasty."
10,"The manager is a major creep who cares only about the bottom line - $$$$$.  Anyone who travels (especially in Central America) knows that sometimes, things do not go according to plan. The manager of the hotel, Michael, was completely unwilling to compromise when we had to suddenly (but within the 72 hour time frame) cancel our reservation due to unfortunate events.  Instead of trying to work with us, he charged my credit card for the entire amount (over $300), saying that, at the Hotel Tikal Inn, business is business. Don't let the door hit you on the way out."
30,"We were booked here for 3 nights, which was too much. Tikal can be experienced with one overnight stay if you arrive relatively early (3-4PM or earlier, so you can go to the park on the day you arrive and see the sunset), or two nights if you arrive late.  The hotel's location is of course the reason to stay here, much more so than the service and quality of the hotel. It's very basic rooms and service is so-so- Slow waiters. Food is ok without being spectacular. The pool is nice. Keep in mind the hotel is located in jungle, so lots of noise, which we found charming and authentic, but it may annoy others.  I would recommend to stay there only to be able to see the sunrise in the national park before the park opens (on temple IV). The hotel arranges tours leaving (when we were"
40,"We spent our last night at the Jungle Lodge and loved it!   My husband and I stayed the previous 3 nights in another hotel (La Casa de Don David) in small town outside Tikal, travelling back and forth each day.   The last day, we wanted to enter the park around 4:30am and watch the sunrise from one of the pyramids.  The room was very clean and comfortable.  The pool was cool and attractive (we watched monkeys play on the trees above).  The restaurant was surprisingly good - easily a 3.5 star.  It was tough having no power overnight, but hey, we were sleeping anyway.  If you go, take a flashlight - you'll need it to go into the park for the sunrise.  It was well worth staying one night.  Recommendation:  Don't go to Temple IV as the other 100 or so people do, go to Perdido Mundo"
40,"We arrived in Flores after a long overnight bus ride beginning in Antigua and wanted to spend the night in Tikal. I'd been told no advance reservations were possible and we wanted to stay at the Jaguar Inn. After taking the 7AM shuttle to Tikal we found the Jaguar Inn was full and went over to the Jungle Lodge. They had a room immediately available and gave us an off-season rate that was pretty much the same as the rate at the Jaguar Inn.  We had an attractive, clean bungalow with 2 comfortable double-sized beds, mosquito netting and a large private bathroom.  We headed out to go zip-lining just outside the park entrance and on our return the pool was almost behind our unit and we relaxed and swam with spider monkeys above us in the trees. We were prepared for the limited times"
50,wonderful stay - restaurant is excellent 
50,"We have stayed at the Jungle Lodge and have found it to be very good and comfortable.  However, I recognize that for some travelers used to 5 star hotels, it may be a disappointment.  We like it so much that we are going back in the Fall of this year.  In many locations such as this, the service you receive is directly related to your attitude and how you treat and interact with the local staff.  The Jungle Lodge location in the park cannot be beat.  When we were last there, we checked out the other hotels and actually ate dinner in one of them and decided that the Jungle Lodge was the best by far! "
50,"This hotel, which is the closest to the entrance to Tikal, has received mixed reviews on TripAdvisor but we found it to be very good as far as the accommodations were concerned. Each room is half of an ochre-painted duplex in a beautifully tended jungle garden. The rooms are large with two comfortable double beds, each equipped with a mosquito net and a fan. The attached bathroom has a shower and constant hot water. Both the bedroom and bathroom were very clean. Electricity was only available from dusk until about 10pm and then in the morning but the staff leaves oil lanterns outside the rooms each night. We chose to leave these on the porch and use flashlights since the rooms can become smoky with the oil lamps.  The check-in staff was helpful and we decided to go on a pre-dawn"
10,"We tried canceling our reservation by phone a week in advance...we didn't have Internet access at the time. There was no answer and no voice mail each time we tried calling. Two days before the day, we finally had internet access and emailed the owner. He stated he'd have to charge our credit card anyway because it was beyond his 72 hour cancellation policy, ignoring the fact that we had tried calling. I understand a hotel owner needs time to fill empty rooms, but answering the phone or getting voicemail seems like it would help. Be wary of this place."
10,"We reserved a couple of rooms for my wife and I and our parents at this hotel. We reserved the room with our credit card. Unfortunately, our itinerary changed and we had to cancel. We called four times before the 72 hour cancellation deadline but no one answered and there was no voice mail. We then emailed the manager - Michael -  to say we tried calling and we regrettably had to cancel. Michael wrote back the next day, made no mention of our attempted phone calls or why no one answered / no voice mail, and said he was going to charge our card anyway - more than $300. He was curt and made no attempt to understand. Our card was charged and we are disputing the charges as fraud as we cancelled before the 72 hour deadline. The manager is unreasonable and his business practices are"
40,"We spent two nights at the Tikal Inn and were very happy with our choice. The room was very clean and spacious,  the beds were comfortable, and the grounds, including the pool, were very pretty. Service was very friendly and helpful. We chose to join a tour that went out at sunset one evening, and then again at sunrise the following day. These were FANTASTIC. Being in the park at those times meant fewer people and more wildlife, plus we were able to avoid the heat of the day. Our guide was Roni, who was EXTREMELY knowledgeable about the ruins themselves and the many animals we saw. Our visit to Tikal--especially the view from Temple 4--was the highpoint of our trip (which is saying a lot since Guatemala is full of great experiences!).  Regarding food, we had one meal at the"
30,"A friend and I spent one night and 2 days in Tikal, staying at the Tikal Inn. We were picked up from the airport at Flores, as promised (always a relief!) and brought to the Inn, about an hour and a half's drive. we organized guides and transport with our hotel booking, our guides were lovely as well as knowledgeable. Food in the dining room was very disappointing. We wished they had stayed with good local dishes rather than try and cater badly for tourists, with bland Italian food or steak and chips etc. The staff were friendly and our room was fine for what we paid. Getting into the very clean, deep swimming pool after a 3 hour trek in the steamy jungle was the best."
50,"We were travelling in low season so rocked up here without a reservation and were taken to a bungalow room by the pool. The room was huge, clean and quiet. The pool was a much needed necessity in the humidity of the rainy season and the perfect place to cool off after the heat of the jungle and the ruins. The helpful front desk staff arranged a sunrise tour for us for the next morning and our guide was fantastic. The front desk staff were also extremely helpful when we found out our flights had been cancelled and assisted us in contacting our travel agent to make other arrangements."
40,"We stayed here one night to be able to visit the ruins for a sunrise tour.  We got a room instead of a bungalow as it was cheaper.  We only got the room and no meals so I cannot comment on the food. - we ate at the local Comedor instead as their meals were cheaper than at any of the hotels.  The only downside, due to it being in a National Park, they have their electricity run via generator and only during certain hours, but if you walk the ruins all day you won't really be affected.  Just make sure you bring a flash light for hours after 10pm to sunrise.  You can't see anything in your room when getting ready for the sunrise tour.  Pros: - Clean room - Hot shower (when the power is on of course) - Easy enough check-in process - Baggage storage should you want to see more ruins"
10,"I was traveling with a group of 4, we had planned to stay 2 nights but because of the bad service we only stayed one night.  We were tunneled in by the tour guide Jose.  He supposely was getting us a deal at the tikal inn, after whispering with the hotel clerk, he decided we would loved to stay at one of the cabanas 2 person per room.  We walked thru sawdust to get into the jungle and they gave us the key, no towels in the room, lots of mosquitos, ants, etc.  we were surprised when we asked for towels that we had to pay another 5 dollars US for each towel.  We took a shower, the drain was puggled so now we had all this water in the bathroom, the commode was leaking.  The whole group was so tired, went to sleep, the electricity cuts off at 10pm, that meant darkness and no fans"
50,"After reading mixed reviews, I was hesistant to book with Tikal Inn.  Nevertheless, my husband and I knew we wanted to stay inside the park, so we made a reservation for one night.  Our primary vacation was in Belize, but we rented a car and drove across the border.  When we arrived at the Tikal Inn, we were met with the hospitality of Ricardo, who gave us an even better deal than what our reservation required.  For a few extra dollars, he included dinner, breakfast, a sunset tour, and a sunrise tour, with him as our personal guide.  Along with about six other people, we met up with Ricardo that afternoon, who took us on the most adventurous, phenomenal, behind-the-scenes tour of Tikal we could have asked for.  (The torrential rain only made it all the more fun!)  We got back"
50,"We were planning to spend one night at Tikal Inn. We spend four. We felt at home the minute we stepped in the door. The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful and went out of their way to help us with every request.  We had a cabana at poolside for the first three night and a room in the inn for the last. The poolside cabana is preferable if you can get it. It's not too luxurious - but comfortable and the pool is right outside. Unlike other hotels we had stayed at, we felt that the staff genuinely cared about us and were proud of their hotel, location and wanted to share it with us.  The electricity is on for only part of the day but it's easy to adjust and this just adds to the ambience. The food was very good and a good compromise between guatemalan and north american"
30,"Don't know where to start. I had an incredibly hard time making the reservation in the first place. Many emails and phone calls later, I had one. Should have realised that's the kind of place Tikal Inn is. Think Fawlty Towers.   Included in the cost was airport pickup. Someone was there to meet us, but we had to wait for another flight to come in. An hour later, we left and inexplicably went to Flores, where we waited another 45 minutes. No apologies.   Once at the hotel, we had a mixed experience. We stayed in a bungalow, which was great (spacious yet super basic, without electricity much of the time, but you're in the jungle. Stay in Flores if you want creature comforts). The only issue was other people--you can hear them through the screens as though you're in a tent. Food"
50,"We arrived from Belize for a 3 night stay at the Jungle Lodge.  Our room was a simple 2 bed cottage with a large bath situated in a beautiful jungle courtyard.  The beds were hard but we were so worn out each night that we slept fine and hoped to be awoken at 2 am. from the Howler Monkeys.  What a treat.  The staff was perfection and always willing to accomodate our every wish.  There were a few who spoke English but I would recommend practicing some Spanish.  The food was great each day and our groups's last meal of Chicken Crepes, Pork Tenderloin and Chicken (with tomatoes) was superb.  We did wander next door to use the internet and found  the food was cheaper but no way near as flavorful.  I would pack some patience and a candle and be thrilled with the conservation efforts"
20,"We arrived at the airport of Flores late at night (unexpected delays). There was no one left anymore, except one guy waiting for a group of travellers in our plain that were going to the Jungle Lodge. Everybody told us the Jungle Lodge was the best place to go, so we asked if we could join. That was OK, he arranged a room for us, so that service was great. The room itself wasn't very special. Two simple beds, a simple shower and toilet, that's it. The electricity goes off at night, so you'll sleep badly because of the moist and heat. Food isn't very special. But the best thing is: it's next to the entrance of the park, so you will be the first to enter and in the early morning, with mist and howler monkeys around you, there's no experience that can be compared to visiting Tikal."
50,Jungle Lodge is the place to be if  you really want to unplug from the modern world and get back in touch with nature. They have remodeled... the food is better than ever... and having howler monkeys as your alarm clock is PRICELESS! If you are a city slicker stay home...   This hotel is for those who love a change of pace and a real adventure of a life time. I have been going to this hotel for 12 years!  I love it... The site of Tikal is amazing and right out your front door!  it doesn't get better than this.  It is a step back to a quieter time on the planet.   Aluna Joy from Sedona Arizona 
20,"The hotel is not the best and the food is not great and overpriced.  We arrived on the early morning flight so our rooms were not ready (we were expecting this so it was fine) and went straight out into the park - no complaints about that except that we were starving because we hadn't had any breakfast!  Our guide, Vinicio, was great and as well as bringing the Mayan civilisation to life gave us an excellent overview of Guatemalan politics and history.  Lunch after the tour is included and was ok but nothing special and dinner was awful. It took 30 minutes before anyone even came to take a drink order and an hour for the food to arrive. When I asked for bread to keep us going we were charged extra for it because it wasn't included in the meal we had ordered - but appeared to be"
40,"The jungle lodge bungalows are basic accomodations and our shower barely trickled out water but the location within Tikal makes up for all that. It was nice to be able to climb out of bed and in five minutes meet a guide for the sunrise tour of Tikal. The lunch at the Jungle lodge was wonderful, the dinner was just okay- we got to the restaurant late and some food in the buffet was already gone.  We walked next door to the Jaguar Inn to use the internet. "
40,"Clean, cool at night, great pool, friendly staff, great tikal guide, flexible, cold beer."
40,"My parents and I stayed one night at the Tikal Inn.  The room for the three of us was really big, it had two king size beds and a twin size bed.  The room itself was very basic nothing fancy, however, it was very comfortable.   The price for the three of us was $135 and included breakfast and dinner.  As many said on the reviews the food is not fancy but it was tasty and enough to fill you up.  The grounds are just beautiful with so many trees and beautiful flowers.  The best part is that you get to see some of the animals that live around the jungle.   We used one of their tour guides to visit Tikal and his name is Roel, he was excellent! We did not have much time to visit Tikal so Roel covered the main plaza which is what we wanted to see.  Roel knew a lot of the history and"
50,"This Inn provides fabulous, knowledgeable guides to Tikal National Park, which enhances the experience. The rooms are luxuriously large, the restaurant is good and the staff ready to help in any way."
50,"I had read the reviews of the hotels in Tikal Park. Once in Antigua, we arranged an fly--in overnight exursion to Tikal that included a stay at Tikal Inn. That was OK, because I really didn't see any significant difference in the hotels. My main concern was lack of A/C in a tropical jungle. I hate to be spoiled, but I live in hot, humid South Georgia and I don't typically cotton to rolling around all night, roasting to death. I can do that without leaving home. But the palapa-style cabana was actually not too hot. We slept OK. The pool and a shower was there to help, just in case. I didn't miss the lack of electricity during the day. The food and drink was a little expensive according to Guatemalan standards, but I guess you would expect that in the middle of nowhere. Truely, my"
50,"you should stay a day in tikal when visiting the ruins and you should stay at tikal inn. its a great hotel. comfortable rooms. yes - electricity is on only in the mornings and the evenings, but you are out through the day, so, it doesn't quite matter. great location. nice pool, lawns.  the staff at this hotel - Raul & Saira - are certainly the best we've every encountered. we were here trying to reroute our tickets as the guate airport was shut due to the volcano + storm. the staff here went over and beyond to help us and present to us options we were not aware of! they were really really nice.  as for sleep, its a tad noise as you near animal sounds well into the night and early in the morning.. but then again, you're in a jungle."
20,"We've just returned from a trip to Guatemala and Belize, and we have to agree with those that were disappointed by the Jungle Lodge in Tikal.  It may have the best rooms in the area, but all the hotels have similar limitations:  electricity for only a few hours each day, limited hot water, etc. so ""best"" doesn't mean anything too special.  What does differ among the hotels is the staff and the level of service, and the cost of extras.  And in this case, the Jungle Lodge falls short of, for example, the Jaguar Lodge, just a 2 minute walk down the road.  The staff at the Jaguar lodge were friendly and helpful -- and the place has kept up with the times, with internet access (when the power is on), and a satellite phone for rent.   The staff at the Jungle Lodge was impolite,"
20,"Our room was large and clean enough, but basic and rather dingy, and the mosquito nets (vital in the jungle) had large holes in them. The food was also uninspiring - Jaguar Inn is definitely better quality and value. The staff at Jungle Lodge itself were all pleasant and helpful, and tours were good and well-organised. However, we did find the tour company with whom we'd gone (Ecotourism and Adventure) somewhat rude and difficult when a problem arose, so I'd  recommend using a different company for Tikal trips. "
10,Food is terrible and the service worse.   The place is fifty years old and showing it.   Management seems to be absent.  Tours are poorly organized and do not run on time.   Constant blaring music from the pool area.  Go to the Tikal Inn or the Jaguar Lodge instead. 
20,"Stayed at the Hotel Jungle Lodge 2 nights, August 5 and 6th.  Upon entrance to hotel, obviously undergoing major construction.  Entire dining and main area being torn down in front of us.  There was no mention of this when we made reservations, nor any apologies by the staff.  We had flown in from Guatemala City on a 6:30 flight that AM with several other people(not traveling with us) Though we were not together, had all arranged with Jungle Lodge for tour.  Upon arrival, found we had no choice and that tour MUST be the first day, versus the second.  This is a daily/usual event for Jungle Lodge.  After being up since 4AM (as are most people who visit Tikal after flying in from Guatemala City), the scenario is to be hurried by Jungle Lodge staff to check in, leave suitcases at"
40,"We were pleasantly surprised by the charm of this property. The bungalows are all newly renovated with beautiful and spacious interiors. There are two double beds in each one.  The only down side is that the hotel runs on generator power at intervals. There is no air conditioning and the ceiling fan does not run when the generator is off, 11PM-6AM and in the afternoon.  The staff deliver kerosene lanterns in the late evening.  The jungle soundtrack at dusk and sunrise is amazing. There are insects, birds and Howler Monkeys serenading. The monkeys sounded like gorillas actually.  One is advised not to venture out after 11PM when there is no light because of the snakes. Bring a flashlight!  Dining was basic and uncomfortable with the heat and mosquitoes. Don't trust the ice! We"
30,"The property is nice. But I agree with the comment that they have to fix the pool. The hotel might have remodeled it last summer but it isn't clean, with insects and leaves floating around. After a hot day in the ruins you are really looking forward for a swim.  The rooms are ok and clean 2 double beds and a small bathroom. Please be advised that there are some rooms that share bathroom, in case you wanted to know.   I would also suggest to the hotel that instead of shutting down the electricity at around 11 pm and turning it back on at around 5 am. That they should shut down electricity during the day, because during the night I had trouble sleeping without the ceiling fan due to hot weather and humidity.  The food is quite good and considering the hotels and restaurants around"
50,"My husband and I have just returned from a trip to Tikal and a three night stay at the Jungle Lodge. The experience was excellent in every way. When reading these reviews, it's always hard to assess the comments without information about the guests, so here goes -- we are 51 and 52, college faculty, pretty adventurous, but completely uncomfortable in dirty or shabby lodging. The Jungle Lodge is not only clean -- it gleams. The bathroom is immaculate, as are the rooms. The beds are firm and the sheets are crisp. The mosquito netting was a wee bit worn, but I saw worse linens in a cruise ship spa. I found that I didn't like using the netting (made me a bit claustrophobic), and I had no bites if I applied some repellent before bed. We saw only one bug in our room the entire time --"
40,"We stayed at this hotel and loved it.  It is in the jungle, and has many comforts of home, but obviously not all.  The bungalows are well appointed and modern, but they practice energy conservation, so bring a flashlight for night.  The management was great, we had no reservation problems as has been mentioned in previous reviews.  Accomodatins were lovely, and the wildlife is beautiful.    The buffet was ok, we ate the breakfast which was included, but if you walk down the street there is a farmhouse/patio where the family that lives there will serve you the best meal you've ever had for next to no money.  The proprietor's name is Margarita, and her and her family are friendly and knowledgeable.    The tour of the Tikal ruins is not to be missed, the guides are locals and know"
40,"A really nice hotel complex, which is situated ideally for your tour of the ruins.  The hotel is surprisingly luxurious for the location and conditions (use of generators).    The only negative side, is the receptionist seem to run the hotel like a military camp!!   The rooms are very nice, with comfortable beds and reassuring mosquito nets.  The fans were a bit point less due to the lack of electricity during the hours of 10am - 5pm, and 11pm - 5am.  Food was fine, really nice pool.  If you have not experienced Howler monkeys before, it can be quite an experience when you hear them.  We experienced this for the first time, when the electricity went off and it was complete darkness inside and out - it reminded us of a few horror films we had seen and was very shocked and"
50,"What an amazing place to stay.  Surrounded by the jungle, with spider monkeys, wild macaws, wild tucans, and howler monkeys all spotted when I was there.  The cabins are apparently the original housing for the archeologists who first explored Tikal.  The rooms were surprisingly comfortable - and sleeping under a mosquito net is actually kinda romantic.  Note that there is only power from 5AM to 10AM, and from 5PM to 10PM, because of their generators.  This is not meant to be a luxury hotel, this is meant to be for those who want to experience the jungle, to be amidst true nature!  Although accommodations are surprisingly classy, if you are looking for the lap of luxury, rather than a true jungle experience, head elsewhere.  Otherwise - book now - this is the experience of a"
40,"I loved Tikal and I loved being next to it at the Tikal Inn. I arrived on Saturday afternoon where I was greeted by the friendly staff Raul. He showed us to our room. Once we got settled in (a nice place with a pool, Ok rooms, but your paying for the location) we went straight to the park by walking. We walked around on a Saturday afternoon around 4pm to an empty Tikal...and what a spectacular place. We walked alot of Tikal in the two hours there it was really great. Also we found out your ticket to Tikal if purchased after 3:30 pm will be validated the next day as well...Sweet. Too bad Ricardo (a must travel guide at the Tikal Inn) was not in town Saturday night for the Tikal Sunset Tour, but he made up for it being there for the Sunrise Tour. What a great tour guide and a"
50,"I visited all three hotels at the entrance of Tikal and chose this one because it has a pool, fans in the room, reasonable rates, and super friendly staff.  The food was pretty good, and the rooms were close to the pool.  The other two hotels (Jaguar Inn and Hotel Tikal I think) seemed good as well, but either were too expensive, or their cheap rooms were too far from the pool, etc...  If you haven't been here before, there is no air conditioning, not in any of the hotels/inns at the park.  There are fans, but the electricity is on only during certain parts of the day.  When I went, end of April, it was *hot* and I was ok sleeping in the bed after a cold shower and their fabulous iced drink.  Somehow the restaraunt was able to make iced drinks, magic.  Overall, a great"
50,"My family made arrangements to travel to Tikal to see the Mayan ruins knowing that we would see incredible things. But the whole experience turned out to be perfect! We arrived in the morning after a brief tour of Flores. Flores is interesting, but nothing like what you will see in Tikal. Anyone who tells you Flores is a place to see instead of Tikal is just plain wrong!  We had made arrangements for my wife and two sons to take a tour and stay over to see the part again int he morning. Our guide in the park was Ricardo, who it turns out is also one of the owners of the Inn. He grew up there and was very talented at keeping our two sons interested and engaged. We could not have asked for a better presentation of the park. And what you see is is just incredible.   We made it back"
50,"We arrived at Tikal two days ago, thinking we would just visit the park and sleep in Las Flores. However when we saw Tikal Inn and its lovely pool we decided to stay there. As last minute walk-in clients we got an excellent deal, half the price of what is normally advertised, and free rates for the kids. We had dinner and breakfast for 20 US extra, and the food was lovely. Our twin boys celebrated their 6th birthday and the cook prepared a cake with 6 candles; all staff came presenting it, lights off, singing in Spanish and English.  We did the evening walk ourselves, no need for a guide, but the Early Bird tour (starting at 5.45) we booked with Ricardo, our guide. He arranged transport to drive us up to the Maya Heaven, because our 4 young kids would have been too tired to walk"
50,"Tikal Inn is one of the loveliest places I have ever stayed. We watched spider and howler monkeys, coatimundis, toucans and deer right in the hotel grounds, relaxed after a hot day in the ruins in their beautiful pool, ate fabulous food in their restaurant, and experienced the best service we have ever experienced anywhere in the world: warm, friendly, genuine, knowledgeable, kind, welcoming... I COULD NOT RECOMMEND IT MORE HIGHLY."
40,"Tikal is such a spectacular place that you can put up with a lot to stay there. The Tikal Inn is a well built and decently run hotel. It has some very nice cabins round the pool -- the only  pool in the Tikal area. The rooms in the courtyard overlook the entrance and we a bit noisy with people standing around smoking outside the door. However, it got quiet after the electricity went off at 10 pm.  The restaurant is well run with a pleasant staff. There is a very limited menu for guests on half board, but the food is well prepared.   Overall I would recommend this hotel if you are staying in Tikal. It is well worth it if you want to get up early to see birds or visit the ruins at sunrise."
20,"We spent two nights here whilst visiting Tikal. Obviously, the location here is perfect for visiting the ruins. You can't really beat it - unless you stay in one of the other hotels Jaguar Inn and Jaguar Lodge which are on its doorstep.  Our room was basic but functional - certainly not anything special. The thing which we really didn't like was the service which seemed to have this 'take it or leave it' attitude. Basically, the guy behind reception didn't seem to really care about any of the guests.   We were particularly annoyed when he booked our transfer to the airport - then charged us a hugely marked up fee for it. Most hotels would do this subtly, but we saw the receptionist pay the driver right under our nose - about 20% of what we paid him!  The breakfast was pretty"
50,"We can't say enough good things about the Tikal Inn.  The staff is the most friendly, helpful group of people.  The rooms are quite clean & comfortable the location is perfect.  We enjoyed the food, the company, the pool, the jungle experience, and everything.  After checking out the other two lodging establishments in the park, I would not stay anywhere but the Tikal Inn."
50,"First of all, if it's an option, please stay inside the park.  Guided tours don't let you experience the place--both the wildlife and the ruins--when they're at their best in the early morning and late afternoon.    The Tikal Inn was everything we could have asked for.  The pool was lovely and well kept.  Our thatch cabana was also nice, if also quite standard.  The power is off for most of the day, but we took that as part of the experience.  Then again, we're used to doing ecotours in Central America so we're used to the up at 5:00 am and in bed by 10:00 pm routine.   We also had a good guide for our sunrise tour through the Inn, and there was great wildlife on the grounds--all kinds of birds including some toucans that buzzed about six feet above the pool.   The grounds were"
50,"Our family (2 adults, 2 kids (ages 12 & 14) and our friends (2 adults and their teenage kids (13 & 15) had a great time at the Hotel Tikal Inn.  We had 2 picturesque bungalows situated right next to the pool which was a great location for sun bathing and proximity to the dining hall but was a bit loud at night because it's such a great nightime gathering spot (but a worthy trade-off).  The hotel is literally in Tikal National Park and a short walk (5 mins) to the actual park entrance gate...very convenient!!   Prices were quite reasonable because they included a hearty breakfast and dinner in the room cost...lunch was not included but is served there on site or you can have them pack you a delicious box lunch for your day time excursion in the park.  We all really enjoyed the"
40,"Staying in Tikal is a great experience! I visited the park on a day trip a few years ago, and much preferred staying overnight to aoid the crowds. Jungle Lodge is made up of pretty duplex bungalows, each with a porch and couple of chairs outside.  The room was very nice and clean, and we had hot water for showers even during hours when the power was off.  The only meals we ate at Jungle Lodge were those included in our package; they were fine, though nothing too special. The rooms here (and grounds) looked nicer than those at Jaguar next door, but we found the food and dining ambience to be better at the Jaguar."
30,"We spent 3 nights at the Jungle Lodge and the location can't be beat.  Only minutes away from the various temples, so you can easily catch them at sunrise or sunset.  (This is highly desirable given the crowds of tourists that descend on the ruins at mid-day!)   We had a room with 2 double beds and private bath.  Everything was very clean and perfectly adequate.  However, keep in mind that you are in the middle of the jungle, so as long as you are not shocked to see ants or mosquitos in your room you will be fine.  Note that all of the bungalow windows have screens, and each bed has a mosquito net for an additional layer of protection just in case.  Staff was friendly enough and smiled in answer to our hello's.  No problems with our reservations that we made through (---). "
40,"I knew I was someplace special when I was awakened at 3:00 a.m. by the roaring of the howler monkeys all around the outside of our thatched bungalow. What a magnificent sound! Like 50 MACK trucks swarming in the air.    Clearly the best thing about this place is its proximity to the ruins. We caught sunset from atop one of the temples, and sunrise from another. The room was spartan but clean. The electricity was occasional. The bathroom was entirely adequate. And the food was satisfying. The rocking chairs on the restaurant porch were also a plus."
20,"First of all, it's hot and humid here in April - nothing the hotel can do about that, EXCEPT have a pool that is functional!  We were looking forward to a cool dip after a hot sweaty day in the ruins and instead found a pool filled with milky colored water.  No explanations, no apologies, not discounts offered.  Our room was nice enough except that the mosquito netting was not as generous (large) as we had at other jungle hotels.  It made sleeping a little more difficult.  Bathroom was beautiful.  Grounds were beautiful - we saw many howler and spider monkeys on the property.  We elected to have dinner at the nearby Jaguar Inn, but our breakfast at the Jungle Lodge was terrific.  Fix the pool, or at least apologize, and this is a 3-star."
40,"We are budget travellers who have returned to the Jungle Lodge several times over the last 15 years.  There are two rows of simple, clean double rooms with two brand new SHARED bathrooms that don't appear to be booked by tours because they have always been available  These are not separate cabins but are in the back against the jungle.  Last year a double was about $27US a night. You need to ask for them specifically. The electricity goes out during the day, the food is a better deal at the Jaguar and the last two times the pool was murky and not very inviting.  But you can't beat the price when you can wake up at dawn and be in the ruins in ten minutes.  "
30,The location of the Jungle Lodge can't be beat...right next to the ruins entrance & close enough to the jungle to see some monkeys and agoudis running around the hotel grounds.  Our cabin was great.  It was bugfree which was amazing considering how many insects were outside.  As for meals...head over to Jaguar Inn...they have a great atmosphere over there and great cold beer and mixed drinks.  Much cheaper than Jungle Lodge...  I had a lot of trouble booking with them online...they never answered their emails...so I ended up booking with enjoyguatemala.     The Jungle Lodge front desk is a bit disorganized and they are infamous with losing reservations...even mine!  All said & done...I really did enjoy my stay at Jungle Lodge.  It is a nice piece of rustic luxury set deep in the
20,"This looked to be the perfect place with few hotels near the entrance to the Tikal Ruins. Wrong. They tried to put us in one of the worst rooms since we had booked in advance. Surprising since no one else was staying there. After arguing with the front desk clerk for about an hour we finally were offered a reasonable room. They have two types: standard and cottages or bungalows. We booked a standard. It turned out that the local staff stayed in a room adjacent right across from ours and stayed up late and rose early in the morning, slamming the doors every time someone went in or out. Plus the staff would gather and talk and laugh just feet from our room every morning before sunrise. I complained to one of the owners and the front desk person was fired, but I don't know what"
40,"We stayed just the one night at Tikal Inn, in order that we could do what many suggest and see Tikal after 3:00pm in the afternoon, and then come again next day and see the rest.  The site is spread out and will take a full day to see everything.  The hotel was clean, nicely furnished with a medium sized pool.  We booked a bungalow room, and this room and the other bungalows are arranged facing the pool.  Our bungalow was very spacious with two large beds (queen-sized?) and a private bathroom. The room was very airy and the breeze flowed through, but if this wasn't enough there was a ceiling fan.  Our stay was very quiet.  Power was restricted to betwen 6:00am  to 8:00am in the morning, and 6:00pm to 10:00pm at night.  We showered during those times and had no problems getting"
20,"Tikal National Park is an amazing place, but I can't recommend staying at Tikal Inn.    I stayed for several days in January 2010.  My original reservation was for four nights and at time of check in they required full payment for the stay, red flag number one.  Our travel plans unexpectedly changed and I notified the manager that I would need to leave a day early.  The management/staff in Tikal is completely powerless to make any executive decisions onsite and had to defer to Michael Ortiz the main ""Manager"" who lives in the US.  After 2.5 days of back and forth, poor communication, and wasted time I was informed that they would be unable to provide a refund to my credit card because their credit card company could not perform such an action.  Interesting?  We left a day early"
40,"We had a great time at the Tikal Inn. Geez, you're in the middle of a jungle. We had excellent service and great food...we were all very pleasantly surprised at how good the food was. I had pancakes for breakfast with a fabulous house-made syrup. The room was certainly clean enough for me, but I have traveled quite a bit. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Tikal."
40,"We decided to go to Guatemala last minute, we debated whether or not to see Tikal as the price was $1000 for two. We did end up going & loved it (we chose a package trip through Rainbow Travel in Antigua).  We flew from USA into Guate, immediately went to TACA airlines, flew to the airport outside of Tikal :: Shuttle to Hotel Tikal Inn, arriving at dark, but early enough to still have dinner. The hotel was perfect, very charismatic/ tropical/ rustic  ... the restaurant was not fancy (which we appreciated) and food good.  Our bungalow was perfect too .. thatched roof / rustic/ plus the muggy air .. we were in the jungle!  Very exciting.  We opted to sleep in  starting our tour after breakfast (we missed the crowds this way too). We had our own guide who was excellent ... perfect"
20,"I was extremely disappointed with this hotel.  The initial communication we had with the staff to arrange our reservation should have sent off alarm bells -- they were slow to respond and neither friendly nor helpful when they did.  The restaurant felt like a cafeteria in the former USSR -- the menu was completely inflexible, the staff totally apathetic, and the food not very good.  The slightest alteration to the set menu (e.g., a refill on a cup of coffee) incurred both an extra charge and scorn from the waitress.  Their cancellation policy is Draconian -- if you need to make the slightest alteration to your schedule, make sure you do it well in advance or they will charge you the full amount.  I felt that they were trying to bleed their guests of money at every turn.  It was"
50,"The hotel staff was great ! The people were so nice to us and being able to walk to the park was great, I am big on customer service and this place provided just that. The food was just OK, the Jaguar Inn next door had better food. The room was clean but very basic, we had a second story room in the back that had a nice patio looking out at the jungle and lots of wild turkeys, birds and other small animals, it was nice to sit and watch the animals and smell the fresh jungle air. One downside was the walls are thin, and we had a family with three small rowdy children next to us which sucked they were very noisy and woke up pretty early."
50,"I've stayed at the Tikal Inn twice, in August 2007 and again in August 2009.  Both times the rooms were clean, large, comfortable, and nicely appointed and the staff welcoming and accommodating.  Having a pool during the hot summer months is sublime.  In 2009 I visited with a group of 12 others in tow, mostly educators.  The staff was especially helpful and we were fortunate enough to have a private early morning tour of the ruins with Roxy Ortiz, an archaeologist whose brother manage the hotel.  I'm not usually a guided tour type but Roxy had all of us absolutely spellbound for more than 4 hours with her knowledge of history and the natural environment and her terrific people skills - highly recommended."
40,"kinda primative but thats the fun ! right in the tikal park   ,,,   walk to ruins every day , stars every night ! good food , pool was only half way full"
30,"I thought this property was charming to look at, (bungalows with thatched huts) and you can't beat the location. The rooms are very basic, but it's great having a pool right outside your door, and the lawn was well maintained. I even saw an agouti (wild animal) strolling across the lawn at dusk. DON'T book a package with food- the food is terribly average, and the menu is overpriced. Also, the package meals don't include drinks, and they charge roughly $4 for non-alcoholic drinks! The food at the jaguar inn restaurant next door was much better and fresher, whereas the food choices for the package meals tasted and looked like cafeteria food (even though it is a table service restaurant), lots of food with little quality, presentation, or flavor. The kitchen staff was very"
10,"The room was dirty, I found 3 cockroach in about 10 minutes inside the room. The hotel policy is a real trap, the check out is at 11 a.m., and even with you really try to see the ruins in about 4 hours is impossible because it is huge, and probably you'll can't return at this time, so they will charge you another day, and a very expensive day, because it is not a cheap hotel. We had many problems with the owners and I can say that they are dishonest people and rude. They are just there to get your money, nothing more."
20,"I booked the Tiakl Inn as I wanted my family to experience the convenience of staying on site, and particularly for the pool, which looks great on the hotel's website.  The staff assured me that the pool was open, but it clearly wasn't.  The level was very low, and the filter system was not working.  The water had a dirty looking sheen to it.  The pool's bathroom/changing room was full of dried tree vegitation.    My advice to anyone considering this or any of the other on-site hotels, is forget it.  Stay 10 minutes away in El Ramate at the Don David."
50,"My daughters and I spent two nights at the Tikal Inn while we were visiting Tikal.  The location of this hotel is perfect for seeing Tikal.  It is just steps away from the entrance to the park which made it really easy to take a very early morning tour of the park and then return after 2:00 pm when the weather was cooler.  Tikal is absolutely amazing and the hotel arranged a tour for us with Roxie, the best guide ever.  Our package included breakfast and dinner, which was just fine with us because there are not many places to eat in the park anyway.  Also, the food was good.  The rooms are simple but adequate.  We came to see Tikal, and didn't expect a five star hotel in the rainforest.  Lights go out at 10:00 pm so bring a flashlight.  Also, mosquito repellent is a must (REI"
50,"I am not a travel agency, tour guide, relative or friend of management or employees at the Tikal Inn.  That said, I have nothing but praise.   I was the chaperone for a group of fourteen of my 15 year-old high school students from  St. Albans, a private school in Washington DC. TACA airlines (don't fly Taca; they'll bump you in a heartbeat !!! take TAG instead) bumped us from both of our flights into and out of Flores from Guatemala City. Our 6:30 flight was re-booked to 10; we left at 11. Our return flight at 5pm was rebooked to 7:30. Net net this meant that we missed our  shuttle connection from Flores to Tikal, our morning guided tour of Tikal, and the return 2 pm shuttle the next day. We arrived sweaty and late for lunch at the Tikal Inn, where we had booked overnight"
40,I chose this hotel based on the other recommendations on Trip Advisor and it was as advertised.  This hotel and one other are literally at the entrance to the Tikal ruins.  The restaurant was nice enough.  The Pool was a welcome site after spending a day sweating in the jungle humidity seeing the ruins.  Like others have stated there is no A/C so be prepared to sweat.  There are fans that help but ours was off centered so you know that annoying sound from an off center fan?  I would still recommend it as a good place to stay where you can walk right to the ruins.
40,"We enjoyed our trip to Tikal and the Tikal Inn.  The staff were very nice and we actually found the food quite good.  I did not like having to buy things on a package, which they kind of forced us to do, but it turned out o.k.  The pool was the most welcome part of the hotel, because it was incredibly hot and teh kids really needed to cool off.  The rooms were poorly equipped with uncofmortable beds and no decoration.  Plus the lack of electricity made it hard to get up at 5 a.m. for our return flight.  But all in all, location is the most important thing, and we liked being in the park."
30,"Our room was large with two Queen beds and private bathroom.  The room was basic, but clean.  The hotel is right in line with the other two Park hotels and having a hotel so close to the Park was a big, big benefit.  Our room rate included dinner and breakfast, which is good because there is no other choice on where to eat, unless one of the other two hotels would serve you.  There is a nice pool too.  The electricity turns off after 10 PM so you must have a flashlight.  Howler monkeys roaring in the morning was very cool.  If you get into the Park after 3 pm, your ticket is also good for the next day.  We loved Tikal, but we were very glad we had a private driver to take us there from Belize.  Guatemala is not safe for tourists, no matter what anyone else tells you.   I'm a"
10,"We did our reservation and prepayment by credit card over the Internet several months before the actual travel.  The bigger was our surprise, when we wanted to check in and were told, that if we do not sign a two pages document written in small script, stating, how the staff distrust the hotel guests and request them to leave 120 USD at the lobby for any incidental costs, what we will have to pay if we lose the room key and what if we just lock the room with the key left inside,...etc, we cannot be checked in.  From that moment we felt like people, who are welcomed only for being peeled off their money without actually receiving any service. We paid for a double room with warm water at the room with half board 198 USD per night.  No warm water.  Instead of staff apology and"
50,"This quiet but elegant Inn offered my friends and me the perfect way to see Tikal. The food was incredible with vegetables cooked to perfection. We had out choice of a chicken,fish, meat, or vegetarian entree. Our guide for the sunrise tour was a archeologist who has worked on some famous digs throughout Guatemala and was enthusiastic as well as knowledgeable. She spent 4 hours answering all our questions. The pool was clean with great bird watching from the deck chairs  The monkeys and gibnuts also visited the area.  There was a family with children staying at the same time and they appeared to also be having a great time. What kid does not want to see monkeys hanging out in the trees b y their room?"
40,Two day whirlwind tour of Tikal was made possible by the wonderful stay at Tikal Inn. Roxy took us into the park at 6:00 AM and told us stories of the Maya. She conveyed a sense that the past is still present and that it is there for us to incorporate into our world view.What an inspiration!Food was good and we felt very welcome.
50,"We stayed at the Hotel Tikal Inn for 2 nights while visiting Tikal.  What I liked: Great to be so near to the Tikal ruins, the ticket booth of which was only about 5 minutes walk from the hotel. My two kids (ages 10 and 12) LOVED running around the very-clean and well-manicured grounds and looking at the animals, Coatimundis (cousins of racoons, but cuter) were everywhere, as were Agoutis (we initially mis-identified them as small capibaras), geckos, lizards, and toads. LOTS of tropical birds visible on the grounds, even more birds invisible but audible up in the trees. Saw more wild turkeys running around than I've ever seen in my entire life. We heard howler monkeys during the night and in the morning, although they were not nearly as loud as some other posters have mentioned."
40,"This place was fine for what it was; a hotel in the jungle w/ limited electricity that provides proximity to Tikal.  Was it overpriced?  Of course, but you have to pay for convenience.  The food was pretty good, I will say that.  And I thought the room was spacious and clean.  They have a ridiculously long list of ""rules"" they give you when you show up that are annoying to even read (like they have to check your room for damage before you check out - have they had bad experiences w/ others before?).  I would note that they're not terribly friendly but it was fine.  The driver from the hotel to the inn was sort of incompetent and was more interested in babbling to his ladyfriend in the seat next to him; he took longer than necessary to get to the hotel, which is irritating when"
50,"We wanted to stay near Tikal N. P. and found the Hotel Tikal Inn the perfect place for us.  They replied to my e-mail promptly answering my questions.  The room was clean with good beds and a good hot shower.  The swimming pool was a welcome refreshment after climbing the ruins in the heat.  The restaurant was good and served generous portions.  The staff was courteous and friendly, especially the assistant manager who talked with us several times. The manager went  well beyond the call of duty  to help us with our transportation needs. The grounds were very well kept also.   We would highly recommend this hotel for its location, value and service."
30,"Due to a last minute change in plans, my friend and I detoured to Tikal.  A wonderful travel agent (William at LAX Travel in Antigua) took care of every single detail.  The price for one night was $115/pp and included breakfast, lunch and a sunrise tour of the park.  The Jungle Lodge was charging $175/pp for the same accommodations.   Through the camera lens, the room (a personal hut) fronting a turquoise pool, the hotel looks impeccable.  But once you break behind the door, the awe fades.  The beds and linens are basic, the towels are over starched and itchy.  And while I understand the limitations due to the reliance on generators for electricity, guests have electricity and warm water for only a few hours a day.  The end result is an inability to enjoy things like, say, a"
40,"We really wanted to stay a couple of nights in Tikal Park, even though the reviews regarding Tikal Inn and Jungle Lodge were mixed. We ended up staying at Tikal Inn because they replied to our emails, and Jungle Lodge didn't. We did not want to do a group tour to the park. Overall, It was definitely worth staying at Tikal Inn because we were free to go into the park when we liked. We enjoyed being there late afternoon/early evening - most tourists had left by then and we saw lots of wildlife, especially monkeys and toucans.  We had a bungalow with a small deck outside, where we could sit out at night with a beer, and watch the fireflies. The bungalow was large and clean with 2 doubles and 1 single. The bathroom was also large with an adequate shower but limited storage space. "
20,"We stayed in the Tikal Inn as part of a high school group tour.  As others have noted, this is a unique hotel.  It is located in the jungle, and is far from any other amenities.  Electricity availability is limited to morning and evening times.  Very limited shopping is available, but selection and price are not as good as elsewhere in Guatemala.  Food service is very slow.  Usually, this isn't a big problem, because there really isn't much to do there besides swim in the pool or chat in the dining room.  However, don't wait to eat until the last minute before your transportation to the airport is scheduled to leave.  You may not have time to get your food!  The food quality overall is average.  The pancakes at breakfast were very good, as was the coffee.  The fresh fruits were"
30,This is the ideal location for visiting Tikal.  The room was very clean however there was only electricity from 6 - 10 pm so be prepared to be HOT without a fan at night. Food was mediocre.  The pool area was the showcase of the property. We got up at 4 and did the sunrise tour which I would highly recommend to anyone going.  Standing at the temple watching the sun come up over the jungle canopy with the sound of monkeys in the background was a most amazing experience.
40,"What a beautiful place~  We had a great experience at this hotel.   It is gorgeous ~ set in the amazing jungle of Tikal.  I highly recommend this hotel. We enjoyed our stay here very much.   The room was great, the food was also good and the pool was fantastic and so refreshing after hiking in the heat through Tikal~ We loved our stay!  And recommend this hotel to anyone going to Tikal!   The staff was nice, there is a lady there who I believe is the manager and she was so sweet and helpful ~  Enjoy!"
40,"13 members of my family stayed last January from the 9th to the 20th. We rented a vehicle at the airport and drove out to the Inn. I had never been out of the country before so this was going to be a real challenge or so I thought. I havent had spanish since 7th grade, I'm 51. My father has been studying the Myans since 1976 and is a noted expert. My uncle is an ornathologist and his skills are well used in this area. The Inn being out in the jungle, you dont have to go anywhere to experience it.  My family was out and about daily. I did what I could, which was hindered by my knee. I spent more time at the Inn and short walks. I was captivated just sitting on my little front porch of our, my daughter's and my bungalow. The birds and butterflies were a daily show. The grounds"
20,"This was my third stay at this property. It has been a pleasant experience in the past, but seems to be going downhill. Twelve of us spent two nights the first of April. Between our six bungalows, two had no water. One unit (ours) was able to be repaired but the other folks had to relocate into another bungalow. Also, be VERY CAREFUL you don’t break any of their precious beer mugs -- I accidently kicked over a glass someone had set on the ground by the pool, and they charged me $4.00/US for breaking it! And although they state the generator will start up at 6:00pm, it is more likely to be 6:15 or 6:30 or even 6:40 one evening."
40,"What a great experience to wake up so close to Tikal, hear howler monkeys and experience the sunrise without having to endure that long shuttle from Flores.  The higher price for this hotel was worth it for the location alone.  As a bonus, we had a pool and nice shady yard in which to relax during the heat of the day.  Good food takes time to prepare, and we were thrilled with the breakfast and suppers that were included in our price.  The staff were courteous and efficient.  Yes, there is a room deposit in case of damage just like any other place you may stay at, we didn't find this out of the ordinary.  About the only thing that I would recommend is a bit better reservation system, as they had emailed me a reservation number and I was happy I had a copy of this email to prove"
20,"I stayed here for several nights, and also stayed at the nearby Jaguar Inn.  I found this hotel to be very overpriced, the food was consistently awful, the service was slow and unfriendly.  I waited over an hour for a plate of spaghetti one night (dinner was included in my room charge).  I ended up walking over to the Jaguar Inn to eat there, because I could never bring myself to finish what the Tikal inn was serving me.  The only redeeming quality of the hotel was the pool, which I admit was nice to jump in after a day of hiking.  However, if I could do it all again, I wouldn't go back."
10,"We booked here because all other hotels in the park were apparently fully booked.  I had some trepidation and it was realised.  On arrival late evening we were presented with a list of hotel ""rules"" and asked for $120 deposit in case of room breakages.  A quick look around the worn out reception with tired cane chairs told me this seemed unrealistic.  Tired, we were shown to our room.  All it contained were 2 basic wooden beds, a small wooden table and a small wooden clothes hanging area.  That was it. Absolutely nothing more.    I don't know quite what damage they thought we were capable of.  We could have trashed several rooms and had change from that deposit.  The curtains in our room look like they'd never seen a washing machine in their life.  The flooring reminded me of a"
20,"There are a few things that are nice about this Hotel, it is very close to the Ruins, and the grounds are very beautiful. The rooms are clean and the bungalows are spacious.   However, I would defiantly recommend against staying at this hotel. The management is very unhelpful and does not try to help you. They are there to get your money, and to make money. That is evident. They charge you for water, and if you purchase their meal plan you get the same meals over and over and over. They charge what is expensive for Guatemalan standards.   We booked some tours with the Tikal Inn.... a very bad idea... by a fluke we were able to get an incredible tour guide, but we were not surprised when he said he doesn't normally work with Tikal Inn because though they charge a lot for the"
30,"Upon reading the previous review I can assure you nothing has changed.  We were located in the 2 story block at the foot of the pool.  The staff did seem a bit clueless with the exception of their assistant manager, Roxy.  Roxy is also an archaeologist and gives tours of the ruins.  She conducted our sunrise tour and was one of the better tour guides I have ever had.  She is also a great assistant manager.  The restaurant food was pretty good with the exception of the coffee.  I had heard coffee in Guatemala was less than good (in a country that produces some wonderful coffee beans, but they are all for export I guess).  The pool was very nice and especially refreshing after a few hours spent walking through the ruins.  As the previous poster advises, go early (at 6AM) and see"
30,"The first thing to say is that if you want to appreciate Tikal at its best you need to be there at dawn and dusk and when the majority of tour groups have left. That really means staying at one of the three hotels in the park--Jaguar, Tikal Inn or Jungle Lodge. I'd heard that Jaguar was more for backpackers (though we ate there and it looked ok) and Jungle Inn never replied to any emails, so I was left with Tikal Inn.  With them too, you have to send about 5 emails before they reply to one, but I put that down to the electric being off a lot of the time!  We knew that power and hot water was only on for a few hours a day (though that was from reading Trip Advisor-people checking in at same time as us had no idea). We'd paid for a bungalow and pictures show this to be a detached,"
10,"I would recommend that nobody go to the Hotel Tikal Inn for any reason.  We were robbed of US $300 IN the hotel by an inside operator.  Next to the front desk in the Hotel Tikal Inn is a sign advertising a sunrise tour of Tikal departing at 5:30 AM for four hours.  We signed up for the January 16, 2008 tour the night before as requested.  Someone from the front desk came to wake us up at 5:00AM - there are no phones in the rooms.  Our tour guide Roxie, who I believe is the daughter of the owner, conducted an excellent tour.    While we were on the tour someone entered our locked room, took $300 US from my wife’s wallet and then relocked the room.  Her wallet was in her closed purse which was in the bottom of her suitcase hidden under some clothes.  When we returned there was no"
40,"This hotel was booked by our guide for one night when we visited the Tikal Archeological Site. It is operated as a modified all inclusive...that is breakfast and dinner are included. The hotel has the advantage of being the only one on site having a pool, which is much appreciated at the end of a hot day trampling through the jungle paths looking at ""old stones"". Our room was just off the pool and was very spacious with high ceiling and windows on two sides offering cross-ventilation.  However, getting hot water is unpredictable, and the electricity is run from a generator which is a bit noisy. The time the electricity is available is posted...usually a couple of hours in the morning and a couple in the evening. Forget about charging your camera overnight, for example, or using"
40,"Very close to the park, short walk to front gate. Clean room and limited power was no problem. A early wake up for the sunrise tour was a plus. Employees were helpful in getting us to the tour and ride to town on time. The Inns guide, Pablo, was the best. Had a vast knowledge of the history, local lore and was very attentive for all the guests. Thanks Pablo you made our day and kept us wanting to know more about the culture of the Mayans. Dennis"
10,"Tikal Inn had so many problems it's hard to know where to start. There were extra charges for a second cup of coffee, no courtesy water bottles in the rooms, no soap, no shampoo. Our rooms included a bungalow and a double room at a $150/night each. The bungalow was actually significantly SMALLER than the double room (we were told they were larger).  The hotel had told us the bungalows had queen size beds, they were doubles. The food which was included in the price of a room was very basic (like pasta), very small portions (our 16 year old son ate a cheeseburger at the Jaguar Inn immediately after Tikal Inn's supper), the menu is  very limited and the same every night.  The park tour  that was supposed to come with the room, didn't.  We  were told to be waiting ready for the"
30,"We stayed one night at the Tikal Inn - it was included in a 2 day, 1 night tour we took through Adrenalina Tours (Antigua - Tikal).  We found the hotel to be completely satisfactory.  Our room was in a 4-plex which overlooked the swimming pool.  It was reasonably large & well maintained with a nice little patio to hang out on during the evening.     Lunch & breakfast at the hotel were included in the tour price.   The food wasn't gourmet, but it was tasty, filling and hit the spot!  The staff didn't fall all over themselves to be of service, but they were friendly and competent.  As noted in other reviews, water was a bit pricy 20Q ($2.50) for a 1.5 litre bottle, but even in the little stores at the visitor center it was priced more than most locales in Guatemala.  Considering"
20,"Tikal itself is absolutely amazing and well worth the trip. We were very keen to see the views at sunrise and sunset so decided to stay at the Tikal Inn for several nights.  Having got such luxury and quality for our money elsewhere in Guatemala, value for money was slightly disappointing. Maybe we'd been spoilt elsewhere but the standard was noticely lower while prices remain high. The location really is the only reason to stay here as the park entrance is just down the road. The surrounding jungle makes the bird watching even in the property fantastic. In the park itself we saw keel billed toucans, parrots and eagles on our first day! We were not expecting great things from the tikal inn but the food was a real low point. As vegetarians we were regularly served eggs (without"
40,"Clean hotel in a pretty spot with a nice pool, but many things are a bit overpriced - better to buy bottles of water at the park and bring them back to the hotel with you."
50,"wonderful place to stay.  Clean, quiet, beautiful grounds "
40,"We spent one night at the Tikal Inn arriving around 3pm one day and leaving around 10:30 am the next. The hotel is convenient, has decent rooms and service. The hotel is set up with a main building containing the lobby, dining facility and, it appeared, a couple of rooms; it has separate huts some of which are facing the pool and some of which are to the side facing an open space, and it has a multroom building (6 triple rooms) that is also on the side and faces an open space. We had two triples on the first floor of the multiroom building. The room was large, tiled floor with two double beds and a small single bed and an attached bath with shower.  Not luxurious, but comparable to what I have stayed in at some US parks. The ""above average"" rating is relative to alternatives."
40,"Very nice place to stay (for Guatemalan jungle). It was well kept  and has an excellent pool area. The food was great. Service was great (except one major issue below).  The location is awesome right on the Tikal grounds. At night we were walking around and there are armed (with a shotgun!) security guards walking around. they stopped us to check who we were and told us to stay on the hotel grounds. It actually made me feel safe, especially being in Guatemala.  The electricity goes off at around 8 or 9 pm for the night, so bring your flashlights. Also if you plan to take a warm shower do it early because the hot water goes off at some time in the evening. This is all disclosed up front so there should be no complaints even if is is inconvenient.  Also, if you do not like bugs or"
30,This is probably the best of the three over-priced lodges near the park.  We rented a bungalow at $150 for the night for three people.  There is a nice pool and meals are included with that price (dinner and breakfast).  There really is no town where you can get food.  No a/c no tv.  Power is on only for a limited time in the evening.  We hoped to see animals but did not have any luck on the property but saw plenty in the park.    You can buy a ticket late in the afternoon (after 3 I think) that is good for that afternoon and the next day.  It is good for visiting the park when there are fewer people and the heat of the day has passed.  the light is better for photographs.  You can watch sunset and then get up early for a sunrise visit.  You need to have a flashlight as it is a
50,"We stayed for one night - and had a great experience.  The staff were very helpful, and organised our sunrise tour.  The room was great for what you need - and the pool was an added bonus (allowing you to cool down in the afternoon sun).  Good value too. "
40,"This was our second visit to Tikal.  We stayed at the Tikal Inn the first time and the Jungle Lodge this time.  The Jungle Lodge was great.  Nice room (for Guatamala) and really good food in the restaurant.  Walking distance to the ruins is, of course, a plus.  The room had two small double beds, clean bathroom with good water pressure and hot water.  I'd definitely stay here again."
50,"We stayed at Hotel Tikal Inn after hearing about it from other tourists in Flores, Guatemala. We were pleasantly surprised at the good service, the comfortable rooms, and the easy walk to the ruins. We would recommend this hotel to anyone who wishes to stay in Tikal. "
40,"The best thing about this hotel is the pool.  Lazing around in it  and watching the hummingbirds flit in and out of the orange cosmos (after getting very hot and sweaty climbing ruins in the park ) is indescribably wonderful.  Staff is friendly but not organized as to when tours leave and gave out misinformation several times (This may have been compounded by an extremely lackadaisical tour guide from Rainbow Tours who accompanied our group). The room was basic but very large,clean and comfortable.  I had  researched this hotel online after booking the tour so knew there was only power from 6 to 10pm but many in our group were unaware of this  - it's posted nowhere.  No power = no hot water, for those who don't swim in pools.  Fresh tangerine juice at breakfast was delicious,"
10,"We spent three weeks traveling in Guatemala and Tikal Inn is the ONLY place where we had big problems.  We came in with a package that included a guided tour of the ruins. We were advised to wait until the second day for the tour, but the second day they messed up and still didn't provide the tour.  We ended up paying 200 Quetzales ourselves for a tour and the hotel would not reimburse us. We got numerous excuses over several days instead of a genuine concern by the hotel to fix the problem.  The manager was rude and evasive in dealing with the problem.  We think there are big problems with the way this hotel is run and recommend NOT staying here since we were essentially cheated. Try one of the other hotels or stay in Remate, 20 minutes outside the park.  By the way, there are"
40,"Tikal is amazing and the hotel is right in the park. Great location.  Good guide through the park. Food not good. Room OK. Lovely pool with trees that attract birds and monkeys. Did the sunrise walk through the park and watched the sun come up over the temples.  It happened to be New Year's day and it was very dramatic.  Not too difficult to climb up temple 4 (the highest). For being in the jungle, I think the hotel was fine. "
40,"We stayed at the Tikal Inn for one night in Jan. 2007. We had originally booked a night at the Jauguar Inn, but once we got there we changed our mind. At the Jaguar Inn there was no pool, the room was $53 for two people, and no food was included. At the Tikal Inn the price was only $50 for two people, including  the pool and dinner and breakfast.   It is really neat to stay in the park and the convenience can't be beat. We stayed in the back building ""C"" about a 100 meter walk down a jungle path. All the other rooms were booked by tour groups. It is so nice to come back from the ruins, jump in the pool and have a beer, while all the other Tikal tourists are riding back to Flores on a bus!   The accomodations were very clean - I saw them sweeping and mopping regularily. The"
30,"This lodge is just fine for those who want more than a few hours at the magnificent Tikal ruins.  It's comfortable (though it would be nice of they provided oil lamps for those post-10 p.m. hours without electricity.)  The food is not great, but we didn't starve.  Staff was friendly enough. "
30,"There are 3 places to stay in Tikal, near the ruins. None of them are any closer than the other. In fact, this one is the farthest (an extra 2 min walk) but has a pool, which is great after a long day hiking around the ruins! We stayed in a bungalow which was very nice and clean--there were 2 double beds and a ceiling fan, which did not come in handy, since there is no electricity after 10pm every night.  We did a 2 night stay, with a tour on the 2nd day. This was much too long to be here. Although the ruins were great and I did enjoy them very much, our tour lasted only from about 9am until 2pm, after that, we were on our own to explore... but had already seen most of the ruins.  We did hang out at the bar/restaurant at the Jaguar Inn (next door) as they have games to keep you"
40,"Stayed at the Tikal Inn for one night. The food was decent but if you want to hangout at night go next door to the Jaquar Inn restaurant. They have cards, board games, and the internet for a fee.  The Tikal Inn is in the process of getting the internet for its customers. The Inn is one of three at the entrance to the ruins in the park.  The rooms are large and comfortable despite the fact that electricity is on only a few hours. You have electricity for a couple of hours at breakfast, then lunch, then from around 6pm until 10pm. It is humid but the showers are nice.  There is also a very large pool that was clean and sparkling when we were there in July. Great place to cool down in after climbing around the temples. Had no problems with mosquitos. Neither one of us received one"
10,"I spent two months traveling Guatemala and had a terrible experience with the hotel management at the Hotel Tikal Inn.  First, we were supposed to be in a bungalow and they put us in a cramped room and the shower did not work.  Secondly, we had ants all in our food at the hotel restaurant.  Third, the hotel staff only put one towel and no toilet paper in our room.  Any time I had a question to the hotel manager, he was ridiculously rude.  I plan to visit Tikal again with my husband and will most definitely take my money and business elsewhere.  Tikal is one of the most magical places...go there!  But due to the rude hotel management at the Hotel Tikal Inn...stay some where else. "
50,"The Gutamala and Tikal Inn experience was my favoite of an extensive trip. Yes the hotel accomodations were basic. The grounds in my opinion simple and beautiful. Pool was great, so was the setting it was in. The value of dinner and breakfast with each night stay cannot be beat. The food was great and the ambiance (with live music accompanying dinner) fantastic. I have nothing but great things to say about the Tikal Inn. The thought of anyone being dissapointed is quite honestly incomprehensible to me. I hope you try it and have the same amazing (even life changing) experience I did! "
50,"We drove ourselves and our two small children into guatamala from Belize.  Quite an adventure itself.  We found the Tikal Inn to be very nice, and certainly couldn't be more convenient!  We loved the ability to walk around at sunset/ sunrise.  Certainly a must if you are coming here.  The crowds aren't there yet and you basicly almost have it to yourselves.  Tikal is amazing!  True the lights go out at 10 and that kind of creeped me out since when we checked in there was a huge monitor lizard in our room and the porter wasn't surprised.  Huge spider in the bathroom and the howler monkeys at night screeching didn't make it a very peaceful night.  But, what a great adventure! The rooms were clean, comfortable and the bathroom was huge and tiled. "
50,"Staying inside Tikal National Park is highly recommended for a number of reasons: 1. You have easy access to the park for sunrise (best time to hear and see birds and animals) and sunset (very picturesque) walks/tours. 2. The accommodations are very comfortable and are set in a beautiful grounds with a great pool (ask for a poolside cabin). 3. The food is fantastic - very fresh, wholesome and tasty. The wait-staff are very friendly.  Go with the room, dinner and breakfast option - it's very good value for the location (about $US100 per night per couple).  Plus there aren't many other places to eat in the park.  If the hotel is busy, I recommend booking a table at the time you want to eat as you may have to wait otherwise. Make sure you book in advance as this hotel is popular. "
30,Pricey?  I paid 25 US dollars per night..  While the pool was green (was there any circulation of water in it???) and there was no electricity at night... its a motel in the jungle what do you expect?  For two days I had a ball exploring the jungles and the ruins... For two days I didn't think about work. That's what a vacation is for..  The bungalows are decent..yet clean. The staff was friendly and happily arranged all travel/shuttle... The food was good. The prices were ok. 
40,"I just had to post a review after reading what others wrote here.  Granted, things may have changed since my husband and I visted two years ago, but we found the Tikal Inn very pleasant all things considered.  The hotel, like the others at Tikal, operates using generator power so electricity is sporadic.  Also, Tikal is incredibly isolated, so the accomodations are not luxurious.  Ok, that's an understatement.  They are basic.  Very basic.  But it's a clean place to stay with a nice pool, simple but delicious food (think grilled meat with steamed rice and veggies), plenty of beer, and friendly enough service. Yes, the bathrooms are...a bit aromatic (but again, clean) and the mattresses are hard.  However, if you have a sense of adventure and know that going into it, you'll be"
20,"All three Tikal hotels are okay-ish.  They are somewhat overpriced and certainly will never win any awards.  Only stay at them if you need to be at Tikal in order to catch either the sunrise or late-night tours.  I stayed at the Tikal Inn last week and I found it to be spotlessly clean and relatively comfortable from a Guatemala perspective.  Power goes off at 10pm and resumes at 6am.  No A/C.  Ceiling fans in rooms.  My wife and I had hot water showers in the mornings.  The place provides breakfasts and dinners as part of the room price.  No choices but the food seemed to be acceptible.  I found the staff to be pleasant and attentive.  Towels were not provided but we asked for some and were quickly taken care of.  Although the place takes credit cards, I declined and paid cash"
10,"Although the rooms and pool (slightly green) are OK, the attitude of the management is objectionable.  Pickups and returns to the airport are done with all people at one time (regardless of plane schedules) because there is only one van, so you miss hours at the ruins and have lots of time at the airport.  Arrangements for tours are mismanaged and staff are rude.  When we requested the box lunch that was to be in our tour (after 8 hours of no food), we were told we could stay at the hotel instead of the tour if food was our focus.  Look for alternatives--the attitude will be a real turn off. "
20,"Our Travel agent recommended this hotel over the Jungle Lodge stating that it was the newest hotel at the park.  I am sure he was correct, however I wish we would have stuck with the Jungle Lodge.   The bathrooms at the Inn had the worst smell even though it was clean.  The electricity was never on and there was NEVER hot water.  The bed linens were rough and the beds were rocks.  Believe me we were not expecting a 5 star hotel, but this was not the nice new hotel that it claims to be.   The resturaunt was even worse.  They offered a menu, but did not serve any items on it.  They only had two choices for dinner and one for breakfast and lunch.   The positive item for this hotel was the tour guide for the park.  He was very informed and educated.  He had a terrific sense of humor"
